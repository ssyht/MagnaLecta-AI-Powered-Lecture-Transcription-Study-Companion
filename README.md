For 2025 MUIDSI Hackathon

This project leverages Generative AI to enhance classroom learning by converting recorded lectures into structured study materials. Using speech-to-text models (Whisper) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system transcribes lecture recordings, processes key information, and generates concise study guides, exercises, and topic summaries to aid students in their studies.

**Features**
- Automated Transcription: Uses state-of-the-art ASR models to convert lectures into text.
- Intelligent Summarization: Extracts key points and organizes them into structured summaries.
- Study Material Generation: Creates flashcards, quizzes, and topic-based study guides from lecture content.
- Multi-Format Support: Works with YouTube videos, audio files, and live recordings.
- Search & Keyword Extraction: Enables quick access to key concepts and important topics.
- Customization & Scalability: Users can personalize the level of detail in summaries.
**Technologies Used**
1. Whisper AI – OpenAI's speech-to-text model for accurate transcription.
2. Hugging Face Transformers – For NLP-based summarization and question generation.
3. LangChain – For structuring and processing transcribed text.
4. Pandas & Numpy – For organizing extracted data into structured study materials.
5. FastAPI / Flask – To serve the AI-powered pipeline via an API.
**How It Works**
- Input a Lecture: Upload an audio file, YouTube link, or a live recording.
- AI Processes the Content: The model transcribes and extracts key information.
- Generates Study Materials: The system summarizes notes, generates quizzes, and provides key insights.
- Review & Download: Users can review, edit, and download structured study aids.
**Use Cases**
- Students & Researchers: Easily create structured notes and study materials.
- Educators: Transform lectures into supplementary learning materials.
- Accessibility: Assists students with disabilities by providing readable transcriptions.
**Future Enhancements**
- Multi-Language Support for global accessibility.
- Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- AI-powered Q&A chatbot for real-time lecture clarification.
