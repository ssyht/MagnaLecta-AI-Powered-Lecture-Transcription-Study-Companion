Mae'r lles yn organ musgol holomusgol ymlaen yn y cavitau thoracig. Mae angen ni ddysgu'r anetomigol bach a'r anetomigol bach yn y lles i ddod yn fawr. Felly mae hynny'n rhan o ddysgu'r anetomiad bach i'w cyfrifio. Yn anetomigol, yn oed yn oed yn edrych ar unrhyw un o'r un. Felly mae'n fel bod yn edrych ar fy chym. Felly dyma fy lles yma. Felly rydym yn dweud ymlaen ar y lles ymlaen a'r lles ymlaen. Felly nid ydym yn mynd i'r ffwrdd. Rydw i'n dechrau'r ffurfio'r chym. Gallwch chi ddysgu'r ffurfio'r holl ffurfio a chymryd eich hun. Felly dyma'r ffurfio'r holl ffurfio'n ymlaen. Ac mae'r ffurfio'r holl ffurfio'n cael ei ddod yn y lles. Felly mae gennym ffurfio'r lles ar y lles yma a'r lles ymlaen ar y lles ymlaen. A'r lles lles arall yn cael ei ddod yn ffwrdd. Felly dyma'r ffurfio'r lles ymlaen o'r lles ymlaen. Ac wrth gwrs, mae'r lles ymlaen arall yn cael ei ddod yn ffwrdd, ond mae'n fwy fwy. Yn olaf, pam mae'r lles ymlaen yn cael ei ddod yn ffwrdd, ac mae'r lles ymlaen arall yn cael ei ddod yn ffwrdd? Wel, fel y byddwn yn gweld, mae'r lles ymlaen yn ceisio lles arall yn y gwaith, mewn i'r cyfrifiaeth systemig. Felly mae'r lles sy'n ceisio arall ymlaen yn cael ei ddod yn eich oed, yn ymlaen, yn y gwaith, yn y brin, yn absolutol arall arall y gwaith, yn y cyfrifiaeth systemig. Felly mae'n rhaid i'n creu cyfrifiaeth cyfrifiaeth gwaith yn fwy fwy, gyda gwaith ymlaen ymlaen. Ond fel y byddwn yn gweld, mae'r ventricol ymlaen yn unig i ddod y lles arall. Ac os yw'r lles yma, yw'r lles yma'n unig. Felly nid yw'n fwy i ddod y lles, felly mae'r bwysig ddim rhaid i'w ddod yn fwy, felly mae'r aml o gwybwynt ddaol yn ddaol. Y peth bwysig yma yw'n yma'r ddod yma. Yn gyfnod, mae angen i ni ddod rhai arterys y bydd yn gweithio'r lles. Yn gyfnod, mae'r ddod yma'n gweithio'r aorta, a hynny'n y vell ymlaen, a'r ddod y ventricol ymlaen. A'r ddod ymlaen yn ymlaen. A yna, mewn i'r ventricol ar y botwm a'r cwmpas ar y top, mae'n dda un pwynt yn y ffordd, fel hynny. Felly yma'n gweld y ventricol ymlaen, gyda un pwynt yna a un pwynt yna. Ymlaen, mae'r cwmpas ar y botwm yn cael ei ddod yn fwy fwyth, felly mae'r fwyth yn fwy fwyth yn ymlaen. A gallwch chi weld yma, mae'n dechrau i ddod un pwynt ymlaen, un o'r cwmpas ar y botwm, y ffordd. A'r ddod yn y ffordd, mae'n dda un pwynt yn fwy fwy fwy f Laser. Rwy'n credu bod yn y diagraff hwn i ni heddiw, rwy'n gwybod y ddod. Felly yma, mae'n dda un pwynt yn fwy fwy fwy, yn ddod y ffordd ar y botwm ymlaen, y ffordd ar y botwm ymlaen. Rwy'n gwybod, mae'n dda un pwynt yn fwy fwy fwy. Ac yn ogystal â hynny, mae gennym y ventricol ymlaen, ac yma gallwn ni gweld yn dda un pwynt yn fwy fwy fwy, y atrium ymlaen. Felly, atrium ymlaen, atrium ymlaen. Ymlaen yn dda, ymlaen yn dda. A'r atrium ymlaen a'r ventricol ymlaen yn cael ei ddod yn atrio ventricular val. Mae'n ymlaen gyda'r atria a'r ventricol, felly mae'n atrio ventricular val. Ac mae'r val yma'n dda cwsb. Mae'n dechrau fel hyn. Mae'r val atrio ventricular ymlaen. Mae'n dda cwsb. Felly, yna bydda'n dda'r val bicwsbid, oherwydd mae'n dda cwsb. Ond ei dda'r anifiaeth yw'r val mitro. Felly, y val atrio ventricular ymlaen yw'r val mitro ac mae'n dda cwsb. Y val yma mewn atrium ymlaen a'r aorta, yw'r val aorta. Mae'r val aorta. A byddai'r ffordd yn cael ei ddod yn atrio fel valau semilunar, oherwydd maen nhw'n edrych fel un hŷn. Felly, y val atrio aorta, neu'r val semilunar aorta. Mae'r val yma yn dda'r ffordd. Felly, fel ydym wedi'i ddweud, y val yma yw'r aorta. Y val ymlaen, a ddod yn atrio'r ventricular ymlaen, a ddod yn atrio'r amser ymlaen. A'r ffan hyn yma, yn oed yn dda, mae'n dda ffan ffan, a ddod yn atrio'r atrium ymlaen. Mae'r ffan ffan ffanol. Ac wrth gwrs, ffanol yn ymwneud â'r lluniau. A'r ddeallau yma'n dda, un atrio'n un pwmpen llai o'r ddod, ond un ffan yn un pwmpen llai o'r ddod i'r ddod. Felly, oherwydd bod yma'n ffanol, mae'n gwybod eu bod yn cael lluniau i'r ddod, oherwydd bod yna ffanol pulmonaidd, gallwn ni gwybod bod yna ffanol sy'n cael lluniau i'r ddod, i'r ddod, o'r lluniau. Mae'n ffanol pulmonaidd. Yn ogystal â'r rhan ymlaen o'r ddod, a mewn y ffordd yma, mae'n ffanol yn llai ar y ddod fel hyn. Mae hyn yn gysylltu i ffanol arterio llai sy'n gwasanaeth yn ddwy. Un brans o'r ffanol yn mynd i'r lluniau. Oherwydd bod y ffanol llai yma, yn ymlaen, yn y ffanol arterio llai. Mae'n gwybod bod ffanol yn gweithio gyda'r lluniau. Mae'n gwybod bod un arterio yw unrhyw ddod yn ymlaen o'r ddod. Oherwydd, mae'r arterio ymlaen yn ymlaen o'r ddod yn ymlaen i'r lluniau. A rydyn ni'n meddwl bod y ffanol yma'n gweithio ar y ddod. A dyma'r ffanol arterio. Dyna'r ffanol arterio arterio, hefyd yn ddiweddarach yn ddiweddarach arterio arterio semilun y ffanol. Felly, mae'n ddigwyddodd a'r ffanol yn ddigwyddodd fel ffanol semilun. Yma, mae'n ddigwyddodd yn ddiweddarach, fel hyn. A'r ffanol, y ffanol atterio arterio oedd 2 cusp. Mae'r un o'n 3 cusp. Felly, dwi'n gallu ei wneud hyn, oherwydd dwi'n cael 2 handiau. Ond byddai un yna, un yna a un o'n oed o'r ffanol, 3 cusp. Felly, mae'n cael y ffanol tricuspid. Felly, y ffanol atterio arterio arfer yw'r ffanol tricuspid. Ond, o ran ymwneud, yn ymwneud, gallwn ni notio bod y ffanol semilun aorol a'r ffanol semilun aorol hefyd yn cael 3 cusp. Ond mae'n yna yna a'n cael y ffanol tricuspid. Yna, y peth y mae angen ni ei wneud yma yma yw'r camion ffynol o'r hap, yw'r atrium rhaid. Felly, yma ymlaen y atrium rhaid ac mae 2 ffanol bach yn cael ei wneud yn y atrium rhaid. Mae'r ffanol sy'n dod o'r holl yn ddod y gwaith ymlaen y gwaith yma yw'r hap. Mae'r ffanol sy'n ddod y gwaith ymlaen y gwaith yma yw'r hap. A'r 2 o'r hyn yn cael ei ddod fel y ffanol ffanol. Ffanol ffanol yw'r ffanol ymlaen y gwaith yma. Mae'r ffanol ffanol ymlaen y gwaith ymlaen yn ddod y gwaith ymlaen y gwaith yma ac mae'r ffanol ffanol ymlaen yn ddod y gwaith ymlaen y gwaith yma. Mae'r ffanol ffanol yn ddod y gwaith yma ymlaen y gwaith yma. Felly, beth y gallwn ni'n ei wneud yma yw ysgrifio'r fflwm o fflwm trwy'r hap. Y fflwm yn dod o'r hap yn dod yn y reinu polmonaidd ac mae'r fflwm yma yn oxigenio. Ac os wnaethoch chi wneud ymlaen o'r hap mae'r hap yn oed yn oed o'r 98 neu 99% yn oed o'r 96 neu 100%. Ac os ydych chi'n ffynol a'n ffit a chael ymlaen o'r hap yn oed o'r 98% gwneud y fflwm yn ddod ymlaen ac mae'n mynd i 100% yw'r fflwm yn gwneud ymlaen ac mae'r hap yn ymlaen yn gyflwyno'r fflwm yn mynd i'r hyn yn ymladdoliol ar gyfer arbennig oedd y fflwm yn ddod ymlaen yn y reinu polmonaidd yn y reinu polmonaidd ymlaen.

Ie, roeddem yn dangos tricuspid 파�en i Rabbi dyn yno. A phan beide d spiritual o fewn, gohe 쓰�ch ar graffos tricuspid iawn, ac mae ennill gars었습니다 ar fod cyfan ay lung, Felly mae'r llwyth o ddod ymlaen yn ymwneud â'r ffwrdd. Mae'n mynd ymlaen o'r atriaeth, y ventricol, y gwaith, yn ôl i'r atriaeth rhan, y ventricol rhan, y arteri pwmri a'r lluniau. Rydyn ni'n edrych ar sut mae hynny'n digwydd yn fwy o ddau yn ymwneud â hynny. Ond, yna, rydyn ni'n edrych ar sut mae'r anatomi yn ymwneud â hynny. Felly, roedden ni'n edrych ar y anatomi basig yma. Mae gennym y ffwrdd o ddod ymlaen, mae gennym y ddod ymlaen a'r anatomi yn ymwneud â'r veneceba. Aorta, arteri pwmri, atriaeth llwyth a'r atriaeth rhan, ventricol llwyth a ventricol rhan. Mae'r atriaeth atrio ventricol yma'r mitrol. Mae'r atriaeth aortig neu'r atriaeth semilunar aortig. Mae'r atriaeth tricuspid yma, a'r atriaeth atrio ventricol yma. Mae'r atriaeth pwmri, arteriol, semilunar. Felly, dyna'r amlwg yma. Mae'r atriaeth a'r anatomi yma yma. Yn ogystal â'r atriaeth, dymaint o'r atriaeth yn ymwneud â'r atriaeth, neu'n ymwneud â'r atriaeth. Felly, ymwneud â'r atriaeth, mae gennym tendynau. Mae'r atriaeth yma'n cael cydnwys tendynus. O'r byddwch chi'n gweld eu cydnwys o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i tendynau. Ond yna'r ddod o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i tendynau. A beth maen nhw yw atriaeth sy'n cael y valfau, ymwneud â'r valfau, a'i stopio'i ddod o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth. Oherwydd, mae'r holl pwynt o valf yn ystrychiad i sicrhau fflwm unig. Felly, rydyn ni'n eich bod y ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth i'r ventricle, ond nid yn ôl yn ôl. Mae hynny'n ymwneud â'r regurgitaeth, sy'n cymryd cyfnod ymlaen. Felly, rydyn ni'n eich bod yn cael ei ddod o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth. Mae'r holl pwynt yn ystrychiad i'r ventricle. I ddod o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth, mae gennym ni'r holl pwynt ymlaen. Mae'r holl pwynt ymlaen yn cael ei ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth, yn ystrychiadau ymlaen, yn ystrychiadau ymlaen, er mwyn eu gysylltu. Mae'r听nysau sy'n cydnabod â'r ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth ymlaen ymlaen. Mae'r mwynt ymlaen. Mae'r mwynt ymlaen. Felly, rydym wedi gweld y cwmpas, rydym wedi gweld y ddod o'i atriaeth, rydym wedi gweld y valwyr. Yr un peth rydyn ni'n mynd i ddod o'i ddod o'i atriaeth pan rydym yn mynd i ddod o'i atriaeth ymlaen yw'r llaiadau ymlaen. Mae'r llaiadau ymlaen. Yn ystyrch ymlaen, mae ganddoedd y llaiadau ymlaen. Mae'r ganddoedd ymlaen yn bwysig oherwydd mae'n rhoi gwasanaeth ffysicol i'r llaiad, yn ymddygiad â'r llaiadau a'r vertebraidd a'r sternum. Mae'n ffyrwch o llaiadau ffibrwch. Mae'n ffyrwch o'r llaiadau ffyrwch. Mae'n ffyrwch o'r llaiadau ffyrwch. Mae'r llaiad yn gallu gweithio'n fwy, pan y byddai'n mynd i'i gyrraedd, ond nid yn ffyrwch, a'r hyn yn ddaerfod y llaiad. Mae'r ffibrwch yn ffyrwch, yn gweithio'r amlwg hwnnw. Mae'r llaiad yn arall ar y ddwyloedd. Mae'r llaiad yn barod, yn unig, ond mae'r llaiad yn llaiad, yn ddaerfod, yn mewn i'r llaiad. Mae'r llaiad yn achod. Mae'r llaiad yn ddaerfod, Mae'r llai yn ystod y llais, mae gennym y llai o ddechrau sgwemus, vasglu a ddechrau endothelol. Mae'r llai yn dda iawn, ond mae'n mynd yn ystod y llai yng nghymru. Mae'r hyn yn bwysig i wneud yn siŵr ein bod ni'n gweithio'n llai o ddechrau. Mae'n bwysig i fod yn dda iawn, oherwydd dydyn ni ddim eisiau rhywbeth o ddechrau y llai yng nghymru. Felly mae'n ffyrdd ddechrau sgwemus, vasglu a ddechrau endothelol. Mae'r llai yna'n cael ymddygiad endocardiaid. Endo yn ystod en. Mae'r endocardiaid yw'r llai yng nghymru. O'r hyn o bryd, mae'r llai yna'n cael y ddwyll, y llai yng nghymru. Mae'r llai yna'n cael y ddwyll, y llai yng nghymru. Mae'r llai yng nghymru. Mae'r llai yng nghymru. Mae'r llai yng nghymru. A'r llai yng nghymru. Roedd yna ddaethau ffyrdd o ffyrdd cyfweliadol, a ddaethu ffyrdd cyfweliadau. Mae'n ffyrdd strieadol. Mae'n ffyrdd yn ffyrdd ffyrdd, sy'n cael y llai yng nghymru yn y ffordd ymddygiadol. Mae'r ffyrdd ffyrdd ffyrdd yn y ffyrdd ffyrdd ffyrdd. Mae'r ffyrdd ffyrdd yn ffyrdd. Mae'r ffyrdd ffyrdd o'r llai yng nghymru yn y ffyrdd ffyrdd ffyrdd. Felly, rydyn ni'n gweld y ffyrdd yma yn ddwy ffordd, y ffordd lef a'r ffordd lef. Mae'r ffyrdd yma yn ddwy ffordd. Mae'r ffyrdd yn y ffyrdd yma, sy'n ddwy ffordd, yw'r septum. Rydyn ni'n gweld y ffyrdd yma, felly mae'r ffyrdd yma yn y ffordd yma, y ffyrdd yma. Y septum. Mae'r ffyrdd yma oherwydd ymddygiadol, oherwydd ymddygiadol yma. Felly, yma mae'r septum cardiac, yn ddwy ffordd lef a'r ffordd lef. A, i ddweud yn ddwy ffordd yn ddiweddar, rydyn ni'n gweld y ffyrdd lef yn ddwy ffordd i'r gwaith. Felly, yn ddiweddar, rydyn ni'n cael y ffordd lef o'r gwaith, y gwaith ymddygiadol. Felly, y ffordd lef ymddygiadol yw'r gwaith ymddygiadol. Rydyn ni'n gweld y ffordd lef yn ddwy ffordd i'r gwaith ymddygiadol, yn dweud y ffordd lef, felly, y ffordd lef ymddygiadol yw'r gwaith ymddygiadol. Felly, y ffordd lef ymddygiadol, y ffordd lef ymddygiadol. Felly, maen nhw'n ystod y strychiadau anatomig o'r gwaith y mae angen ni ddod o'r gwaith, a dyna'r gwaith ymddygiadol o ddod o'r gwaith ymddygiadol.\", 'TKNqIU5P3As': \" Hi, I'm Professor Akshar at Glendale Community College. This is Physics 101, Lecture 1. In this lecture, we'll discuss units and dimensions. These topics are covered in Chapter 1 of our textbook by Surway and Jouette. Physics is ultimately an experimental science, and as such, we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature. To perform those measurements, we need standards of measurement, or units for our measurements. The three quantities that we will want to measure most often, at least in this class, are length, time, and mass. To measure these three quantities, we will use the International System of Units, which is also known as the SI system. The abbreviation SI refers to the French designation Système International. Using the SI system of units, we'll use the meter to measure length, we'll use the second to measure time, and the kilogram to measure mass. The meter and the kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you, hopefully all of you are familiar with the second, but by the end of this semester, you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is. The experimental work that we'll do in the laboratory section of this class should help you with that. In our study of mechanics in this class, we will encounter other units in addition to the meter, the second, and the kilogram. However, any other unit that we encounter, at least in this class, can be represented or expressed in terms of the three base units, the meter, the second, and the kilogram. For example, later in the semester when we study forces, we'll find that the SI unit for force is the newton, and the newton can be expressed in terms of meters, seconds, and kilograms as shown here. So although the newton seems like a new unit, it really is just a combination of the kilogram times the meter divided by second squared. A little bit later, we'll talk about energy in this class, and we'll find that the SI unit for energy is the joule, and the joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared. Shortly after that, we'll talk about power, and we'll learn that the SI unit of power is the watt, and the watt is simply the kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed. At this point, it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from, and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force, energy, and power are. The important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well, because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units. Now, for the sake of completeness, I should mention that there are other base units in physics. It turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units. In this class, we're primarily interested in the meter, which measures length or distance, the second, which measures time or duration. We're interested in the kilogram, which measures mass. But if you go on in physics and engineering, you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature. The SI base unit for measuring temperature is the Kelvin. If you take a course on electricity, magnetism, or circuits, you will want to measure the electric current, and that is measured in amperes. If you've ever taken a course on chemistry, you have probably encountered the mole, which measures the amount of substance. If you want to measure luminous intensity, one would use the candela as the SI base unit. We're really only going to use the first three, but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here. We will need to convert between SI and non-SI units. Primarily, we're interested in SI units. That's our preferred system of measurement. But in different applications, you will inevitably encounter non-SI units, and it's important to know how to go back and forth between the SI and the non-SI units. This table here shows a variety of SI units on the left and non-SI units on the right. Some of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized. You should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimeters. In fact, the prefix centi basically means one one hundredth. So when we talk about a centimeter, we're talking about one hundredth of a meter. Therefore, there are a hundred centimeters to a meter. One meter is equal to 3.281 feet. One meter is also equal to 39.37 inches. A thousand meters is referred to as a kilometer. The prefix kilo means a thousand. So a kilometer or a kilometer is a thousand meters. A mile is approximately 1609 meters. A minute is 60 seconds. An hour is 60 minutes, and each minute is 60 seconds. So 60 times 60 is 3600 seconds to an hour. One kilogram is a thousand grams. A kilogram is also approximately 35 ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds. You don't need to memorize all of these, but some of them, the ones that are in blue, the ones that I've indicated here in this third or last column, are the ones that you should memorize. These are common enough that you will encounter them frequently, and you should know what these conversion factors are off the top of your head. The other conversion factors, the ones that are in black font, are not so important to memorize. It's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are. On an exam, I would probably give you the conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it. Whenever you report the result of a measurement, you should report the units that you used for that measurement, along with the number. That way, the person that is reading your report knows how to interpret the results of your measurement. Units are important in their own right, but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units. Keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations. Keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations. Keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's the right formula for a particular quantity. For example, later in the semester, we will encounter the centripetal force. At this point, it may not be obvious what the centripetal force is. That's not so important. We'll discuss it at length and I'll give you the right formula for it. At some point, you might forget exactly what the formula for centripetal force is. By the end of this semester, you will have encountered hundreds of formulas. On the final exam, you might forget whether the centripetal force is mv divided by r or mv squared over r. In this context, m stands for mass, v stands for velocity or speed, and r is simply distance. Again, we'll talk about all this in much more detail later, but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether the right formula is mv over r or mv squared over r. It turns out if you're paying attention to the units, you can actually figure out which one of these two, the one on the left or the one on the right, is the correct formula. If you have an equation and it's a valid equation, then numerically the left side must equal to the right side, but you want the units to also match. In other words, you want the units of measurement for whatever appears on the left side of the equation to match the units for whatever appears on the right side of the equation. For both of these equations, the left side represents force, as we'll see later, the SI unit for force is the Newton, and a Newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared. I've used the square bracket here. The square bracket indicates the units of. So when I put square brackets around the quantity, I'm not really referring to the value of that quantity. Instead, I'm referring to the unit for that quantity. Now let's look at this formula here on the left. The claim is that force is equal to mv over r. What are the SI units of mv over r? Well, if m is mass, then it's measured in kilograms. V is speed, so it's measured in meters per second, and r is a distance, and that's measured in meters. You can cancel the meter that you see in the denominator here with the one that you see in the numerator, and this reduces to simply kilograms per second. You can already see that this is not a good match. What we have for force is this quantity here, a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared, and what we have for mv over r is this unit. This set of units obviously does not match this set of units, so this is an indication that this formula is wrong. On the other hand, our other formula says force is equal to mv squared over r. The square brackets again indicate the units of mv squared over r. m is kilograms, v is speed. We're going to measure that in meters per second, but it's speed squared, so it's going to be meter squared per second squared, and r is distance, so that's going to be measured in meters. You can see that this m here cancels one copy of the m in the denominator, so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared, and these units match exactly the units for force, or a newton basically. If I'm trying to decide between these two formulas, I can now tell you that the one on the left must be incorrect and the one on the right must be correct. This is not a proof that the formula is correct. However, if you know one of these formulas, then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is the correct one and which one is the incorrect one. As I mentioned earlier, we have to know how to convert between Si and non-Si units. Sometimes these conversions can get complicated, so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions. The method that we want to use in this class is known as the factor-label method. I'll demonstrate the factor-label method using an example problem. The peregrine falcon, considered the fastest animal on earth, has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hour. What is the speed in Si units? So here we've specified the units, but the units are not the same as the units on the left. We've specified the units for speed as miles per hour. Miles and hours are not Si units. If we want to convert to Si units, we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds. So we'll need two conversion factors for this process. Looking through your textbook or perhaps the internet, you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hour. You should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters. And you should know off the top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds. You should also know the following fact from algebra. This is simply a mathematical fact that if A is equal to B, then A over B is equal to 1. It doesn't matter what A and B are, if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other, as shown here, you can divide both sides of this equation by B and show that A divided by B is equal to 1. Why is this fact important to us here? Well, it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, then the ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to 1. So if a quantity on the left is equal to a quantity on the right, I can divide both sides by, let's say, one hour, and what I'll get is 1. This is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply the speed of this falcon by 1. And multiplying by 1, of course, does not change the quantity, so it's a mathematically permissible process. More precisely, this is what I mean. If you want to convert something using the factor-label method, you write the quantity first, and make sure you write the units down as well, miles per hour, then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert. I want to do two conversions, miles and hours, so I'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here. I know that 1,609 meters is equal to 1 miles, so when I write it as a ratio, I'm really just writing 1. I also know that 1 hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, so when I divide 1 hour by 3,600 seconds, I'm getting 1. Which means basically I'm multiplying the number 242 by 1, and then by 1 again. Now notice how I've written these ratios out. I've chosen to write the mile in the denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this mile. I've also written the 3,600 seconds in the denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have the hours cancel out. So if you look at this product, you'll see that miles here cancels miles here, and hours here cancels hours here, and what we're left with is meters and seconds, which is exactly the same as the number 242. So I can put everything into my calculator. 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second. That's the speed of the Falcon in SI units. Here's another example for you to consider. We have a cylinder. The cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and the base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet. The base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of 6 feet. Calculate the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet. Notice these quantities, these dimensions here are given to you in feet, so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of the problem. We do need to know what the formula for the volume of the cylinder is. Hopefully you remember that. To calculate the volume of the cylinder, you must calculate the base or the top of the cylinder, which is simply pi r squared, and then you multiply that by the height of the cylinder. So now I can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by 6 and don't forget pi. When I put all this into my calculator, I find that the volume of the cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet. It should make sense that the volume is cubic feet because after all I've taken the radius, which was measured in feet and I've squared it, so that's feet squared and then I've multiplied it by the height, so that's a third copy of the same unit, so I end up with cubic feet here. Now let us convert this volume to SI units. What we want to do is convert feet to meters. Looking at your book, you will find that 1 meter is approximately 3 feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet. So now what I can do is I can go back and convert the radius to meters. I can also convert the height to meters and then I can take those converted numbers, plug them into this formula, use the formula one more time and calculate the volume in cubic meters. However, there is another way of doing it. Rather than using this formula one more time, I can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters. If I'm going to do the foot to meter conversion, I need to remember that this is feet cubed so I need three conversion factors. So here I've written 1 meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and I've done it three times and by doing it that way I've made sure that cubic feet here gets canceled by feet, feet and feet here and then what I'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly the SI unit for volume. Now I can put all this into my calculator, I can simply divide it by 3 divided by 3 or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and the final answer is 3.336 cubic meters. And that is the end of this lecture. Thank you for your attention.\", 'qnEZQRpWWi8': \" Alright folks, welcome to a semester in economics and what we're going to do in this very first lesson is we are going to define economics and try to get an understanding of what it is exactly this subject that we're learning. So you should have a notebook in front of you or some paper so that you can take notes and I recommend that you write down everything that I write down up here on the board in your notes so that you can study and add a few extra notes of things that I say or maybe some things that will trigger memories while you're learning this stuff. So what is economics? Well I have my own definition, there's probably several definitions out there, I'm sure there are plenty of textbooks that have definitions of economics. Well there's one in particular that I like to work from and I'm going to give you that definition right now. And after I give you that definition, so we're going to say economics, what is economics? After I give you my definition I'm going to break down the definition into four main pieces so that you can have a better understanding of how we're going to focus on learning this semester. So here's my definition of economics. To me, economics is the scientific study of how individuals, that's like people, right, individual people, organizations, so that's like businesses or maybe government organizations or not-for-profit organizations, groups of people who come together to either make a profit or achieve some kind of goal, or let's say, or societies. Now a society is like an entire country or an entire city or an entire state, okay? Change that to a societies or societies deal with the problem of scarcity. Scarcity, okay, that's S-C-A-R-C-I-T-Y, scarcity. That's the most important word right there, scarcity, that is the main word in economics, that is the most important word in economics. If I were to give you a much simpler definition of economics, I would just simply say it is the study of scarcity, and I'm going to talk about scarcity in just a few minutes. So there are four main elements of this definition. The first thing I want to tell you is that economics itself is scientific, that it focuses on individuals, organizations, and societies, so that's its own one category. Economics has to do with how these groups or individuals, how they deal with. Now the idea of dealing with is the idea of making a decision. When you want to deal with something, you know, when you get a flat tire, you have to deal with that flat tire, and what that means is to make decisions about how to handle that flat tire. So dealing with is the idea of decision making, having to make a decision. A decision about what? Well, a decision about the fact that you are facing the problem of scarcity. You as an individual are facing the problem of scarcity, or an organization is facing the problem of scarcity, or an entire society, a country, or a state, or a city is facing the problem of scarcity. And like I said, I'm going to define scarcity in just a little bit. So here are the four things we're going to focus on is economics as scientific, economics as focusing on individuals, organizations, and societies, economics as dealing with decision making, and economics as handling the problem of scarcity. So in order to do that, what I want you to do right now is I want you to, on your notes, in your paper, I'm going to break up the board into four quadrants like this, four quadrants, and I think you should also break up your notes into four quadrants, and we're going to put each one of these subjects in each one of these quadrants. So economics is scientific. So we're going to talk about what that means. Economics is concerned with individuals and organizations or firms and societies, whole, large groups of individuals. That economics focuses on dealing with deal with. What does it mean to deal with something? And then lastly, we have the problem of scarcity, the problem of scarcity. So we're going to take these one at a time in the order that they are in the definition. So economics is scientific. So economics is a science. There are scientific journals devoted to economics. There are people, researchers, people who get paid to study economics, researchers who get paid to study economics, researchers who get paid to study economics, researchers who get paid to study economics, researchers who get paid lots of money. Well they probably don't get paid as much as they want to get paid, but nonetheless there are people who get paid money just to do research on economics, research on the problem of scarcity, research on individuals, organizations, and societies and how they deal with the problem of scarcity. And because economics is scientific, there are certain things that go along with all science. And those two, and two of those things that we're going to focus on, we're not going to do all of science, but the two main things I want you to understand is that in science, when we approach a subject in science, we have to make assumptions and we have to draw conclusions. We make assumptions and we draw conclusions. Now I want to clarify something here, and that is this class is a principles of economics class. This is not some masters or PhD level class where we're going to dig very deep into the research of economics. What you're supposed to be learning in this class are the basic, foundational, fundamental principles of economics, and that's what I'm going to focus on. So here's what I'm going to do. When we talk about these assumptions and conclusions, especially the assumptions, I want you to understand that the assumptions that we're going to use in this economics class might not be the kinds of assumptions that would be used in a much higher level economics class. So if you decide that you're going to someday get a masters or a PhD in economics, you might find out something, you might learn something in that economics class and think back to this class and say, wow, Professor Ryan was wrong. What you have to understand is that the assumptions that we're going to make are important when you're at the beginning stages of learning economics. So I'm warning you that some of the things that we're going to learn throughout this semester, some of the things that I'm going to teach you are really only foundational principles, but when you get to higher levels of economics, oftentimes we relax or eliminate those foundational concepts and augment them into something much more detailed or much larger or much grander. So I'm warning you in advance, this is a principles class. You are learning the basics of economics. So one of the basic assumptions, I'm going to give you two basic assumptions in economics. The first one is called the Ceteris. That's C-E-T-E-R-I-S Paribus. That's P-A-R-I-B-U-S. That's the Ceteris Paribus assumption. I'm going to put quote marks around it. What does Ceteris Paribus mean? Ceteris Paribus basically means to examine one variable by not changing any of the other variables. You are holding everything else constant so that you can isolate the effects of a single variable on some other phenomenon. So Ceteris Paribus says that we are isolating all other variables so that we can examine one variable that's changing. Because here's what's going to happen in this class. I'm going to say something like, hey, you know, when things are cheaper, people buy more of it. And then you're going to say, well not always, sometimes when things are cheaper, people don't want them at all. And I'm going to say, you know what, you're right. Sometimes things are so cheap that people don't want them at all. But I'm using the Ceteris Paribus assumption. We're going to assume that it's the kind of product that everybody wants. And so now if it's a product that everybody wants and the price goes down, people are going to buy more of it because they do want it. We're going to assume that it is something that people want. So for example, if the price of garbage goes down, people may say, no, I don't want any more garbage. I'm trying to get rid of my garbage. Well, yes, I agree with you. But if we're talking about something normal like a cheeseburger or french fries or a car, then we can assume Ceteris Paribus that when the price goes down, that people will buy more of it. So that's our first assumption in economics is the Ceteris Paribus assumption. The second assumption, what is the second assumption? Oh, the second assumption is rationality. Rationality. Okay, now this is a really, really, we got to be very flexible with this rationality assumption, but we're still going to, we're still going to use this rationality assumption in this principles class. Here's what the rationality assumption says. The rationality assumption says that people in general are rational decision makers. Meaning if you give them a choice of whether they can have $20 or $30, that they will choose $30 every single time. And you might say to yourself, oh, there must be some kind of catch. No, I'm telling you, there's no catch. Your choices are $20 or $30. Which one do you want? Everything else is the same. And then obviously the rational person is going to say, well, I'd rather have more money than less money, so I'm going to take $30. Yes, exactly. We're going to assume that you are a rational person, that I am a rational person, that I want more good stuff and I want less bad stuff in my life. That is rationality. Okay? So that's the second assumption. And because economics is scientific, we have to start somewhere and where we're going to start is that we're only going to look at one variable at a time and then also we're going to assume that people are making rational decisions. That they're not insane, that they are not out to get worse things for themselves and less better things. No, that doesn't make any sense. We're going to assume that the people, that the individuals, the organizations and societies that we're dealing with are rational. Okay? All right, now let's move on to conclusions. Oftentimes what we do in economics is after we learn something new or after we understand something, we then draw a conclusion. Right? And here's how it goes. For example, let's say that people are spending more of their money on one kind of cereal. People are spending more money on Lucky Charms than they are spending on Cheerios. And so we might draw a conclusion. Well, if people are buying more Lucky Charms than Cheerios and Ceteris Paribus, they both have the same price, then people must like here, I'm going to draw a conclusion now. Well, I'm now going to conclude that people prefer Lucky Charms over Cheerios. Now that may not be true in reality, but in my example, that is a conclusion. And oftentimes when we draw conclusions in economics, there are two kinds of conclusions that we can draw. We can draw or we can come to conclusions that are what we call positive conclusions or normative conclusions. And what we're going to try and focus on in this class is we're going to primarily focus on positive conclusions, not normative conclusions. Positive means, let's see here, what is. What is. And normative conclusions are what should be. What should be. We are going to avoid the what should be conclusions. Now you're going to want to make some normative conclusions. As you go through this class, you're going to say, oh, because of that, that means that's terrible then this is what we should do. So for example, you might say, oh, we might find out economically that there are people in this world who can't have health care. They can't get help when they're sick. And you may think to yourself, oh my goodness. Now the fact that we conclude that there are people who don't get medical help, that is a positive conclusion. That is just a, it's just a truth. We draw, nobody would argue. Generally speaking, people do not argue over positive conclusions. And so what I'm going to put over here is I'm going to say here, no arguments. No arguments over positive economics. Sometimes we call it positive economics and normative economics. So I'm going to put positive econ and here's going to be normative econ. So in positive economics, generally people do not argue over the truth. Everybody agrees that 17% of the people get no health care at all. Yes. What do your numbers say? 17%. What do your numbers say? 17%. We all agree there's no argument, but here's where it becomes, here's where it becomes argumentative. People disagree over what that means we should do. People disagree because of their values, because of their value judgments. So values, because of their values, people disagree on normative economics about what should be done. And what some people are going to say is, wow, well those 17% of people, they should be able to get medical care and therefore what we should do is take some money from somewhere and give those people medical care. And some other person, because they have different values, they're going to say, no, that's not what it means at all. That would be very expensive. We can't take money away from those other things to give health care to these people. They're just going to have to deal with not having health care. And this is where people argue is in the normative economics. We will do a little bit of normative economics and you will hear me make statements that are related to normative economics. And I may say some things that you will disagree with. And when you disagree with me, chances are you have different values than I have. And that's okay. You can have different values than me. You should have different values than me. You can have very similar values. But generally speaking, every human being has a different set of values. And so we're going to disagree sometimes on what should be done. But positive economics is what is, generally speaking, there are no arguments over that. And here's what I'm telling you. As far as positive economics, one of the things that we're going to learn in positive economics is the fact that when the price of something goes down, people do buy more of it. And we're going to get to that in a much later lesson. But that's an example of positive economics. So economics is scientific.\", 'FRd28CLvMQM': \" In our last lecture, we saw that the theoretical predictions of Maxwell and the experimental validation by Hertz seem to give us an idea about the fundamental nature of light. Light seems to be consisting of electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic oscillations. However, this idea would probably only survive a couple of decades before it would be questioned against the experiment. Due to some experimental observations related to what is known as thermal radiation. Based on this, I am going to make three or four video lectures discussing what blackbody radiation is, the classical explanation towards blackbody radiation and the Planck's postulate giving us a resolution to the ultraviolet catastrophe and giving us an explanation of what blackbody radiation is. So this is going to be the very first lecture of that. In today's video, I want to discuss what blackbody radiation is and what are the experimental observations associated with blackbody radiation. So first of all, let us try to understand what is blackbody radiation. You see everything around us, all the objects are emitting thermal radiation by virtue of their temperature, by virtue of the heat contained in them. Now, if I say something like that, you are going to ask me, but sir, I don't really see objects glowing automatically, right? For example, if I have a chalk, a piece of chalk, like this is blue in color, this is orange in color. If I take another object like a ball, which is yellow in color, if I switch off all the lights, I cannot see them. They are not glowing in light, right? They are only reflecting the light that is falling on them. Well, you see, I used to watch when I was a child, I used to watch in Discovery Channel these episodes of search and rescue missions, where the police or the detective would search for somebody in the dark or maybe in the forest, where they would have these infrared cameras and they would detect people moving through the woods or to the forest or in the dark by virtue of the infrared cameras, because infrared cameras are capable of detecting the light that is being emitted from our bodies at all times, but we cannot really see them. By virtue of the heat contained in our body, we release infrared radiation or radiation having wavelength just slightly larger than visible wavelength that we cannot really see with our eyes, but they can get detected by certain kinds of cameras and using those cameras, people can detect where people are, other people are by virtue of their heat released through their bodies. So you see, our bodies are emitting infrared radiation all the time and not just our bodies. Other objects are also emitting various kinds of electromagnetic radiation at room temperature that do not really fall in the visible spectrum. For example, if I take some kind of a piece of metal and heat it to sufficient temperature, it would start glowing with red color. If I increase the temperature, it would become slightly orange in color. If I increase the temperature further, it might become yellow and then slightly whitish or bluish. So you see that not only objects are emitting thermal radiation by virtue of the heat contained within it by virtue of its temperature, but when we increase the temperature, the wavelength that we see that is being emitted is usually also changing with respect to that particular temperature. The reason we don't really see this in our day to day lives is because most of these objects emit radiation at a particular spectrum or at a particular frequency that is not really in the visible spectrum that our eyes are capable of detecting, but nonetheless they are emitting this radiation. And this radiation is called thermal radiation. And it is this radiation that we are interested in studying and it is this radiation that will reveal to us some of the fundamental concepts in physics that we had previously in classical physics that we would need to change as we go forward in our understanding of modern physics. So how do we study this radiation? How do we detect this radiation? Well, you see, if you have any kind of object or a metal surface, let's suppose, and I maintain this metal surface at a particular temperature, then usually the light that falls onto the metal surface or is incident on the metal surface, most of it gets absorbed by the body, right, because of the pigments that it usually has. But some of these wavelengths will not be absorbed by the body and they may get reflected backwards. The wavelengths that are reflected and are not absorbed by the object usually give us their distinct colors. So for example, if I have this chalk that is blue in color and white light is falling on this chalk, some of the wavelengths are going to be absorbed by the pigments in the chalk and the blue wavelength is not going to be absorbed, it is going to be reflected and as it falls into my eyes, I see that it has bluish color. Similarly, if I have an orange chalk, then it is absorbing all the wavelengths other than the orange colored wavelengths, which is getting reflected back and falling into my eyes. And this is how various objects get their characteristic color. But apart from this reflected radiation, you see, I had on one hand incident radiation, some of it is absorbed by the object surface and reflected radiation based on the characteristics of the surface. Apart from all of that, I may also have thermal radiation, may or may not be in the visible spectrum, but the object also emits, all objects emit what is called thermal radiation and it is this radiation that we are interested in studying. So now the question is, how do I separate the reflected radiation from the thermal radiation? We do not really have a filter that if I put a detector here, it will be able to detect, okay, this is the reflected wavelength and this is the thermal radiation, so I am going to separate it. We do not have any kind of a filter like that. Therefore, we need to create a special kind of an object that will emit all the reflected radiation falling on the surface so that the only emitted radiation coming out of the surface is the thermal radiation. So for example, if I can create a new surface, let's suppose, and this surface is also at a particular temperature T, and all the incident radiation falling on this surface gets absorbed. If all the incident radiation falling on this object gets absorbed, then the surface would appear black, okay. So if the object is at room temperature and the thermal radiation does not really fall in the visible spectrum and it absorbs all the incident radiation falling on it, then the object would look black. So then we can call this a black body. So a black body is essentially some kind of an object that absorbs all the radiation falling on it. So it is a perfect absorber. But because it is a perfect absorber, it is also a perfect emitter in the sense that now all the radiation that comes out of the surface would be purely thermal radiation and this thermal radiation will be called black body radiation. So therefore, if we can create an object that absorbs all the radiation falling on it so that it becomes a perfect absorber, that is a black body, and then it emits radiation by virtue of its temperature, by virtue of its thermal energy contained within it, and that thermal radiation is the black body radiation that we are interested in studying. An example of this kind of an object would be like something that has been painted with a very dark black colored pigment like Vantablack or something like that. But even in those cases, vast majority of the radiation, even though they will be absorbed, a very small tiny portion of the radiation will get reflected backwards. Scientists have tried to create a setup that will be ideal or close to ideal black body. And the way they did that was by creating what is called a cavity. So let's suppose that we have some kind of a cavity with metallic walls inside. Imagine that this is some kind of a cavity with metallic walls inside, but it has some kind of a hole on its surface, a very small hole on its surface. If this is the kind of a construction we have and some kind of an external incident radiation falls on this hole, then after undergoing successive reflections on the inner surface, we can for sure say that this kind of an incident radiation will be near perfectly absorbed by this cavity. So if we have this kind of a construction, all the incident radiation that is falling on this particular cavity having this hole on the surface will absorb all the radiation falling on it. Now therefore, this kind of a setup would be a near ideal black body setup. So then we can use this setup to study the black body radiation. How? Because if we have this setup, this hole essentially would behave like a black body. So now if we heat this kind of an object to some kind of a temperature, then the walls would start emitting radiation. The inner walls will start emitting electromagnetic radiation or thermal radiation. If we increase the temperature of this kind of an object sufficiently, then this thermal radiation would also approach the visible spectrum of the electromagnetic radiation. And now if the cavity gets filled with thermal radiation that is being emitted by these kind of inner walls, then some portion of those radiation will also come out. And this radiation that is coming out, this tiny portion of radiation that is coming out from the cavity, this can be studied to give us an idea about what is the nature of the black body radiation spectrum. So this is the clever technique that was used by scientists to create a setup that would be an approximately ideal black body that emits radiation by virtue of its temperature. And then we can study the black body radiation spectrum to get us an understanding of what the nature of this radiation is for all kinds of objects. So if we have that kind of a black body in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, which means that it radiates as much energy as it absorbs so that the temperature of that black body is a constant, and we study the spectrum of the radiation coming out of that black body, then we get something very very interesting, something that looks like this. So here I have a 2D graph with the x-axis that represents the frequency of radiation and the y-axis represents what is known as the spectral energy density, which means the amount of energy per unit time per unit surface area that is being emitted by the black body in a cavity for a given range of frequency. Now let us try to study the different kinds of experimental observations that we are interested in. The radiation has a very well defined energy distribution. To each frequency there corresponds some kind of an energy density that is completely independent of the chemical composition of the body or the shape of the body, but only depends on the temperature of this body. So this is our first observation that we get this kind of a very much well defined continuous energy distribution. The second observation is kind of very simple. It is just the nature of the graph itself. So for example, the energy density per unit time or the power that is radiated by the black body for some fixed interval of frequency is very small for low values of frequency, but it increases rapidly as frequency increases. It reaches a maximum for some fixed value of frequency. We are going to call that mu max and then decreases continuously for further increase in frequency and approaches 0 as frequency tends to infinity. This is a very simple sort of a graph representing a very simple observation, but we will see how difficult it is to explain it later on. There are some additional observations associated with this. So let us go to the third observation which is known as Stephen Boltzmann law. You see we are only studying the amount of power radiated by the black body for some fixed interval of frequency. What about the total amount of power radiated by the black body? So if I sort of trace the area under the curve, if I trace out the area under this curve, let's suppose I am interested in this entire area, then this area would give us the total amount of power that is radiated by the black body for all frequency range at a given temperature. It was found experimentally in 1879 by Stephen and later on derived theoretically in 1884 by Boltzmann, therefore known as the Stephen Boltzmann law, that this total amount of power emitted by a black body at a given temperature is actually directly proportional to the fourth power of temperature. That means if I have multiple black bodies or if I change the temperature of a given black body and look at how this kind of a distribution changes, we will see that the area under the curve increases by a proportionality of fourth power of temperature. So let me draw a couple of more graphs corresponding to different temperatures. So you see here the shape of the graph remains more or less similar but the size of the graph increases with increasing temperature. So for example, let's suppose initially we had the black body at a temperature of T1 and then we increase the temperature to around T2 and then we increase the temperature further to T3 such that T1 is less than T2 which is less than T3. In that situation the black body spectrum of these three distinct bodies at different temperature would look something like this. Such that the area under the curve which is the total power emitted by the black body would be directly proportional to the fourth power of temperature. This is known as the Stephen Boltzmann law and the proportionality constant sigma is known as the Stephen Boltzmann constant. It has a value of 5.67 into 10 to the power minus 8 watt per meter Kelvin to the power minus 4. This is a very interesting graph. So let's look at the fourth experimental observation related to the black body radiation. Now if you notice the different temperatures and the peak of the black body radiation and how it is shifting to the right then you would see that with increase in temperature the peak associated with the black body radiation spectrum is also shifting towards increasing frequencies. That would give us what is known as the fourth experimental observation which is known as Wayne's displacement law. The Wayne's displacement law simply tells us that if we associate with the peak of the black body spectrum some kind of a frequency value because the peak of the black body spectrum is associated with some fixed frequency. I'm going to call this new max. So new max is the frequency at which I get the peak of the black body spectrum for one body. For another body the peak might lie somewhere else. For the third body the peak might lie somewhere here. The Wayne's displacement law tells us is that the peak associated with the black body spectrum corresponds to a frequency which is directly proportional to the temperature. So with increase in temperature the frequency corresponding to the peak of the black body spectrum also increases linearly. This is the nature of the Wayne's displacement law. Sometimes in some books the law is specified in terms of wavelength. We can also obtain that. So what is frequency? Frequency is nothing but the speed of light upon wavelength. So if I look at the distribution instead of in terms of frequency but in terms of wavelength then I can associate some wavelength corresponding to the peak of the black body spectrum then we have c upon lambda max is equal to I can say let's suppose or proportional to temperature. In that situation if we introduce some kind of a proportionality constant then lambda max times t is equal to the proportionality constant and this proportionality constant is known as the Wayne's proportionality constant and the value of this proportionality constant is 2.89 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter Kelvin. So the Wayne's displacement constant or the proportionality constant basically gives us an idea about how the frequency and the temperature are correlated. You see if you are reading different kinds of books you will see different kinds of black body radiation spectrum distribution. In some books they give us energy density versus frequency. In some books they might give you a little bit of a different looking graph which is energy density versus wavelength. So if you are looking at that particular graph you would see that instead of the black body spectrum shifting towards the right in those graphs where the x axis is wavelength the black body spectrum will be shifting towards the left because frequency is directly proportional to temperature. So with increase in temperature frequency increases but wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. So essentially with increase in temperature the entire black body spectrum shifts towards higher frequencies or lower wavelengths. Alright so these are some experimental observations of the black body spectrum. We have the Stephen Boltzmann law, we have the Wayne's displacement law and of course we have this kind of a distribution that graphically looks something like this. Now if we have some sort of a phenomena in physics the purpose of physics is to come up with an explanation. That is what a scientific theory is. Right? The whole purpose of physics is to come up with an explanation to explain why things are the way they are. So when we are studying the thermal radiation that is being emitted by objects or the black body radiation we want to explain why it is the way it is. Now classically speaking it is not really that difficult to explain why objects would radiate energy. This is because objects have heat contained within them. Right? No object is at zero temperature. Every object has some amount of heat contained within them. What is the meaning of heat? Heat means the atoms, the molecules they have some kind of a vibration going on. Right? So atoms have charged particles like electrons. So if a charged particle like an electron is vibrating then that vibrating charged particle would emit electromagnetic radiation. So if an object is at a certain amount of temperature all the particles that make up the object has some kind of a thermal agitation going on and they are emitting radiation and that radiation is nothing but the black body radiation we are studying. So conceptually it is not very difficult to explain. But what about the specific nature of this graph? What about the specific nature of these expressions? Can we explain that classically speaking? That is where the interesting journey begins. You see classically based on our understanding of classical thermodynamics, classical electromagnetic theory, many scientists tried to explain the specific nature of a graph that the power emitted by a black body for a fixed width of a frequency increases, reaches a maximum, decreases, goes to zero. Now that was very very difficult to do. In fact that led to the ultraviolet catastrophe or the failure of classical physics in explaining black body radiation which is where Max Planck came and gave some different idea or different way of looking at this particular experiment which we are going to call the Planck's postulate which would give us the starting point of something very fundamental about how matter and radiation interact with each other. In classical physics radiation can be emitted in a very continuous fashion but in quantum physics it is not like that. But we will reserve those discussions in the coming lectures. In the next video lecture I am going to talk about a very specific classical explanation which is the Rayleigh-Jeans law. I am going to show you how based on classical considerations we can actually derive an expression to calculate the black body radiation and we will see whether that explanation correctly predicts this kind of a spectrum or not and then we will take the discussion forward. So this is all for today black bodies and black body radiation spectrum and their experimental observations. I will see you in the next video. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye bye. .\", 'nEWNNt2KmfQ': \" Hi, in this module, I'm going to cover the basics of linear regression. Our story of linear regression begins on January 1st, 1801. Italian astronomer Piazzi looked up at the night sky and discovered something, which he named Ceres. He didn't know what it was, was it a comet or a planet, but he did make some observations of the location before it was obscured by the sun. The data he collected looked like this. At a particular time, two numbers which represent the location of Ceres in the night sky. So now the big question at the time was when and where was Ceres going to be observed again to emerge from behind the sun? All the top astronomers at the time went and tried to analyze this data and figure out the answer. So Karl Friedrich Gauss, famous German mathematician, took Piazzi's data and created a model of Ceres orbits and makes a prediction. This prediction was actually wildly different from all the other predictions that other astronomers made, but in December, Ceres was located and Gauss' prediction was by far the most accurate. So now there's an interesting story here. Gauss was actually very secretive about what his method was. And in 1805, the French mathematician Jean Lejean was actually the first to publish the method before Gauss could publish in 1809, even though Gauss had this method back in 1795. The method here is none other than least squares linear regression, which is the topic of this module. So here is the framework. So we are given some training data, which consists of a set of examples. Each example consists of an input x and output y. So 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3. And we can visualize these examples on a 2D plot here, plotting y, the output, against x, the input. So here is 1, 1, here is 2, 3, and here is 4, 3. So what we want to do is take this data, have a learning algorithm, produce a predictor F. And the predictor in this case is, let's say, a line. And what the predictor allows us to do is to take new inputs, such as this 3 here, and send it through and produce an output, 2.71, corresponding to this point on this line here. And there are three design decisions that we need to make to flesh out this framework. First, what are the possible predictors that the learning algorithm is allowed to output? Is it only lines or is it curves as well? This is a question of what is the hypothesis class. Second question, how good is a predictor? And the answer is going to be framed in terms of determining a loss function that judges each and individual predictor in the hypothesis class. And finally, how do we actually compute the best predictor? There are a lot of predictors there. And even if we have a loss function, how do we go searching for them? And this is going to be the question of the optimization algorithm. So this is a recipe that we're going to see over and over again. And it's kind of like a build your own learning algorithm. So we're going to start with the first question. What is a hypothesis class? So here is that predictor that we were looking at. And that corresponds to this red line. And here's another one. Here's a purple predictor, which has an intercept of 2 and a slope of 0.2. And in general, you can consider predictors of the following form. f of x equals w1 plus w2 of x for arbitrary w1, which is the intercept, and w2, which is the slope. So now we're going to generalize this using vector notation. So let's take w1 and w2 and pack them up together into a vector, which we will call w. This is called a weight vector. And we're also going to define a feature extractor, also known as a feature map, phi. So phi is going to take an arbitrary input x and return the vector 1, x, at least in this case. And 1, x is going to be known as the feature vector. So now we can simply rewrite this equation up here in vector notation. So we're going to write f sub w to denote that this predictor depends on the weights of a particular input x is equal to w.phi of x. And this w.phi of x, which we'll see over and over again, is called the score. So here's an example. If you've thickened 3 into this predictor, then what we're doing is taking the weight vector and dotting it with the feature vector applied to 3. And remember the definition of feature vector is 1, x. So that's 1, 3 here. And if you take the dot product, 1 times 1 plus 0.57 times 3, that gives you 2.71. So now finally, the hypothesis class is defined as the set script f is the set of all predictors f sub w, where w can be an arbitrary intercept and slope. w is an arbitrary vector. So that defines our hypothesis class that we're going to be working with. So now let's turn to the second design decision. How good is a predictor? So let's take our predictor that we're looking at, the red one, and let's look at some training data. So this is the training data that we had before. Let's plot the predictor and the three data points. This one, the 2, 3, and 4, 3. So intuitively, how good a predictor is, how good it fits the training data. And we're going to quantify that by measuring the distance between the prediction and a target. This difference is called the residual. So we're going to measure the residual for each of our points, and we're going to take that into account. So formally, we're going to define a loss function, which is a function of an example of x, y, and a particular weight vector. And that's going to be equal to the prediction, f of x, minus the target y. So that's the residual here. And I'm going to square it. So that is called the squared loss. So as an aside, you could also take the absolute value here, which gives you the absolute deviation loss, but we're going to stick with the squared loss for mathematical components. So on these three examples, we can compute the loss. So we take 1, 1 and the weight vector. We dot them together. That's the prediction. You subtract off the target and that is, and square it, and that gives you 0.32. Second example is 2, 3, and the third example is 4, 3. Each one gives you a loss function, which corresponds to the square of the length of these dashed lines. So now we can define the training loss of a particular weight vector to be simply the average over the losses. So formally, this is going to be a sum over all the examples in our training set. So these and of the loss function of a particular example with respect to that weight vector. And then finally, we're going to just divide by the number of points in the training set. So in this example, we just average these three numbers and we get 0.3. So that is how we define the squared loss and the training loss in terms of the squared loss. So here is a training loss as we had from the previous slide, and we can visualize this. So for every single weight vector, we can stick it in and get out a number. Fortunately, W is only two dimensional here, so we can plot this actually. So here is a plot, W1, W2, and every point here gives you a training loss on the z-axis. So red here denotes high loss, blue here denotes low loss. And so it's natural to think about how you would find the point here with the minimum training loss. And that's captured mathematically as minimum over W of train loss of W. So this is the optimization problem that we want to solve. So now the third question is, how do you compute the best? So fortunately, we already have our well-defined goal. We want to find the weight vector that minimizes the training loss. And we're going to adopt a very simple strategy called follow your nose. So you start at a particular W, and then you sniff around, and then you just move in a direction that seems like it's going to reduce your loss the most. More mathematically, we're going to define the gradient as the direction that increases the training loss the most. And importantly, we want to go in the opposite direction because we want to decrease the training loss, not increase it. So pictorially, what the follow nose strategy or gradient descent is going to look like is you're going to start at some W, and then you're going to follow the gradient, and you're going to end up here. And then you're going to compute the gradient, you're going to end up here. And you might bounce around a bit, but hopefully you'll decrease the loss on average over time. OK, so here's the pseudocode for gradient descent. So we initialize W to be something, let's say zeros for simplicity. And then we're going to repeat big T times. Big T is the number of epochs. And what we're going to do is we're going to take our old value of the white vector, and we're going to subtract out some eta, which is called the step size, which we'll get into a little bit later. So here's the step size times the gradient. So grad of returning loss of W. So that's called the gradient here. OK, so that's it. There's three lines and really only one line that's of interest here. And that's all there is to gradient descent. OK, so at least at an abstract level. So all that remains to do is to actually compute the gradient. So remember, here is our objective function. So gradient descent is actually much more general than just the square loss or even machine learning. And now we just need to compute the gradient. And if you remember your calculus, here's how you do it. So the gradient with respect to W of the train loss of W. So remember, there's a lot of symbols here, but we are differentiating with respect to W, not X, not Y, not V. And this is going to be equal to the gradient of this expression. This is just a constant. So the gradient can be pushed inside. And this is a sum. The gradient can be pushed inside of some linearity. So this is a sum over the training set again. And then, so now the interesting thing happens. So here is something squared. The gradient of something squared, you bring down the two and then you have the same gradient which is, you remember, the residual times the gradient of what's inside here. And what's inside here is W dot V of X. V of X is a constant. Y is a constant. So the gradient of that residual is just V of X. And so notice that there's something interesting I want to point out here, which is that the gradient can be expressed as the residual times the feature vector where the residual is the prediction minus the target. So intuitively, you can think about if the prediction is equal to the target, then the gradient is zero. So nothing will happen. And if the prediction is not equal to the target, then the gradient will be in the direction that sends the prediction away from the target and remains in the direction that the gradient is coming from the target. And remember, we're always minimizing, so we're subtracting that off in which we'll move the weights in the right direction. Okay, so let's walk through the gradient descent for our example here. So here's a training example. Again, here is expression for the gradient that we just computed on the previous slide. And here is the gradient update where I've taken the liberty of just substituting the step size to be just 0.1, just for simplicity. Okay, so we start with W equals 0, 0. And then what we're going to do is plug in 0, 0 into this training loss expression, this somewhat nasty looking thing. And that is this. This is just simply the average three examples, one over three. Here's the first example. Here's the second example. Here's the third example. Each example consists of dot product, the prediction minus target times the feature vector of that example. So I'll let you go through the details here, but if you do the math, you get minus 4.67, minus 12.67. You multiply by the step size and you get this weight. Okay, so now the second iteration, you're going to take this weight vector, stick it into this expression all over again. You compute a new gradient and then you subtract that gradient times 0.1 from this weight vector and you're going to get a new weight vector. And then you keep on repeating and repeating. So after maybe 200 iterations, you're going to end up with something like this. And something interesting happens. If you're lucky, the gradient at the end will be 0. So what does 0 mean? So 0, if you subtract out 0, you get the same thing. So means that gradient descent has converged. By subtracting off the gradient, you're not going to move anywhere. And so you might as well just stop. And the stopping point is this weight vector 1, 0.57, which is indeed the red classifier. So just to concretize this even more, let's do gradient descent in Python. So I'm going to pull up a terminal here. So in practice, you probably wouldn't implement gradient descent from scratch, except for if you're just trying to learn about gradient descent. But for pedagogical purposes, let me do this. So I'm going to do this in a kind of very bare bones way. So I'm going to use NumPy rather than PyTorch or something that can do gradients for you. First, I'm going to define our training examples as 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4, 3. I believe those are the training examples. Let me just double check over here. 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3. OK, so now I have to define a feature vector of x, which is, remember, it is 1x. This is just a NumPy array. I'm going to initialize the weight vector with, let's call this initial weight vector. And this is just going to be all zeros vector of dimension 2, which is going to match dimensionality of phi. OK, so now I need to define the training loss. Training loss takes away vector. And I'm going to actually go to the previous slide here. And it's just basically copying down math and turning it into code. So this is 1 over the number of training examples times the sum. And the sum is over for all training examples, x, y, and training examples. And for each one, I'm going to do w dot e of x. It's really literally the same thing, minus y. And I'm going to take this expression, the residual, and I'm going to square it. OK, so let's make this a little bit bigger. OK, so that's the training loss. OK, now I need to take a gradient. So I'm going to cheat a little bit and just copy that down here and edit it. So the gradient of the training loss is going to be 2 times the residual times e of x. OK, so that's it for the training loss. OK, so now I'm going to implement gradient descent. So I'm going to do it this way, actually. So gradient descent, like I alluded to before, is actually a general purpose optimization. So all it needs is a function, gradient access to that function, and initial weight vector, and it's ready to go. So I'm going to initialize w to the initial weight vector. And then I'm going to, let's say, eta to 0.1. For a number of iterations, t in range of, let's just say 500, just for fun, I'm going to evaluate the function at w. I'm going to evaluate the gradient. And I'm just going to do the one-line thing of subtracting out eta times the gradient from the existing weight vector and setting it to the new weight vector. And I'm going to print out where I am. So f of t, w equals w, f of w equals the value. And let's do the gradient, just for fun. So grad gradient f equals the gradient. OK, so now I just need to call gradient descent with what function am I optimizing? The train loss. The gradient of the train loss is the gradient of the train loss and the initial weight vector. OK, so that's all I have. And let's actually just run it. Gradient descent. So we see here that in f of 0, the weight vector is something and the function value is something, gradient something. And over time, the function value is going to decrease, which is a good sign. The gradient of f is going to start becoming more zero. And the weight vectors are now converging to 1, 0.57 as advertised. So I will declare this program working. Let's just kind of summarize what we did here. So I want to set this up as follows. So here is the optimization problem, which is how you have the training example, the feature vector, the loss and gradient and so on. And this is kind of a specification of what the problem we want to solve is. And then down here, we have the optimization algorithm. And we're going to be doing this a few times throughout the course, drawing kind of modules where we can separate the optimization problem from the optimization algorithm. Notice that the optimization algorithm, again, doesn't depend on anything relating to machine learning at all. And the optimization problem doesn't say anything about how you solve it. So it's coupling this what from the how, I think, is a really important theme. OK, so that was gradient descent in code. And let's summarize now. So in summary, we take training data. We have a learning algorithm that produces a predictor that can produce new predictions on new inputs. And there are three design decisions or build your own learning algorithm, which predictors are possible. That is a question of hypothesis class. And we consider linear functions here where the function is simply W dot V of X with a particular feature map, one comma X. You could imagine other things. We'll see other things later, nonlinear features and even neural networks. But it's still the question of what is the hypothesis class? How good is a predictor? That's a question of what is the loss function. For regression, we looked at the square loss. Later for classification, we're going to look at the hinge loss and the zero one loss. But this is orthogonal for neural networks. We can also look at the hinge loss or the square loss or any of the losses. And finally, how do we compute the best predictor? This is a question of what is the optimization algorithm. And for this, we introduce gradient descent, which is this lovely, simple and very effective algorithm for optimization. So that concludes this module.\", 'kiuwtaprFjk': \" So here is something funny. You might say, OK, what is simpler, a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear? And the answer, of course, a linear theory is much simpler. Maxwell's equations are linear. Einstein's theory of relativity is very nonlinear, very complicated. How about classical mechanics? Is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear? What do we think? Can't hear anyone. Linear, OK. You may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple, but it's not. This actually is very nonlinear. Newton could solve the two-body problem, but he couldn't solve the three-body problem. Already with three bodies, you cannot superpose solutions that you get with two bodies. It's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics. Let me show you. If you have motion in one dimension, in 1D, you have the equation of motion, motion in one dimension under a potential v of x that is time independent, a particle moving in one dimension, x with under the influence of a potential v of x. The second, the dynamical variable is x of t, the dynamical variable. And the equation of motion is, so let me explain this. This is force equal mass times acceleration. This is mass. This is acceleration, the second derivative of the position. And v force is minus the derivative of the potential evaluated at the position. Derivatives of potentials, if you think of a potential, the derivative of the potential is here positive. And you know you have a mass here. It tends to go to the left. So the force is on the left. So it's minus. So v prime is the derivative of v with respect to its argument. And the problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operation, if you take two derivatives of a sum of things, you take two derivatives of the first plus two derivatives of the second. But yes, this side is linear. But this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary. And the derivative, so suppose the potential is cubic in x. v of x goes like x cubed. Then the derivative of v goes like x squared. And x squared is not a linear function. So this Newton's equation is not a linear equation. And therefore, it's complicated to solve, very complicated to solve. So finally, we get to our case, quantum mechanics. So in quantum mechanics, what do we have? In quantum mechanics, it's linear. First, you need an equation. And whose equation is it? Schrodinger's equation, 1925. He writes an equation for the dynamical variable. And the dynamical variable is something called the wave function. This wave function can depend on t, depends on time. And it may depend on other things as well. And it describes the dynamics of the quantum system as it evolves in time. There is the wave function. And you have an equation for this wave function. And what is the equation for this wave function? It's a universal equation. i h bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to h hat psi, where h hat is called the Hamiltonian. And it's a linear operator. That's why I had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is. This is the general structure of the Schrodinger equation. It's a time derivative and a linear operator. So if you wish to write the Schrodinger equation as an L psi equals 0, then L psi would be defined as i h bar d dt of psi minus h hat psi. Then this is the Schrodinger equation. This equation here, Schrodinger equation. And as you can see, it's a linear equation. You can check it. Check that L is a linear operator. Therefore, it is naturally linear. You can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operation. If you have the d dt of a number times a function, the number goes out. You differentiate the function. d dt of the sum of two functions, you differentiate the first, you differentiate it. So this is linear. And h, we said, is linear. So L is going to be linear. And the Schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation. And therefore, you're going to have the great advantage that any time you find solutions, you can scale them. You can add them. You can put them together, combine them in superpositions, and find new solutions. So in that sense, it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics. And in fact, you will see throughout this semester how the mathematics and the things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics, are more elegant, more beautiful, more coherent. It's simpler and very nice. i is the square root of minus 1, is the imaginary unit. And that's what we're going to talk next on the necessity of complex numbers. h bar, yes, it's a number. It shows up in quantum mechanics early on. It's called Planck's constant. And it began when Planck tried to fit the black-body spectrum. And he found the need to put a constant in there. And then later, Einstein figured out that it was very relevant. So yes, it's a number. For any physical system that you have, you will have a wave function. And you will have a Hamiltonian. And the Hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover. So if you have a particle moving on a line, the wave function will depend on time and on x. If you have a particle moving in three dimensions, it will depend on x vector. It may depend on other things as well. Or it may be like one particle has several wave functions. And that happens when you have a particle with spin. So in general, always time, sometimes position. There may be cases where it doesn't depend on position. You think of an electron at some point in space. And it's fixed. You lock it there. And you want to understand the physics of that electron locked into place. And then position is not relevant. So what it does with its spin is relevant. And then you may need more than one wave function. What is one describing the spin up and one describing the spin down? So it was funny that Schrodinger wrote this equation. And when asked, so what is the wave function, he said, I don't know. No physical interpretation for the wave function was obvious for the people that invented quantum mechanics. It took a few months until Max Born said it has to do with probabilities. And that's what we're going to get next. So our next point is the necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics.\", 'RBSUwFGa6Fk': \" Let's talk about data science and some of the other related terms you may have heard, such as predictive analytics, machine learning, advanced analytics, and others. So let's start with the textbook definition of data science. So data science is the field of study that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take. Okay, so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science. So really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines. We start with computer science, but then we also cover the area of mathematics. And then what I think is the most important is business expertise. So the intersection of these three disciplines is data science, and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas. Okay, so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do. Now, what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization. And these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them. So let's chart them here by complexity and value. Okay, so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics. This is really about what is happening in my business, right? And it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening. So a good question we could ask here is, well, did sales go up or down? The next level is diagnostic analytics. And this is more about why did something happen? So why did sales go up or down? And it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem. Now, the next one that we have is predictive analytics. So this is about what is likely to happen next, right? So what will our sales performance be next quarter? And it involves using historical patterns in our data to predict outcomes in the future. And then finally, we have prescriptive analytics. So this is about what do I need to do next? What is the recommended best action for a particular outcome? So a question we could ask here is, what do I need to do to improve sales by 10%, right? Okay, so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it. So let's look at the data science life cycle. And the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding. So this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative. And this is where you can see that having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions. Okay, so once we've defined that, we can move on to data mining. So this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis. So once we've done that, we can move on to data cleaning. So the reality of the marketplace is that when we find data, it's probably not in the best format that we need it in, and it probably has some issues with it, right? It might have rows that have missing values. It might have duplicates in it. So this is the preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis. So once we've done that cleansing, we can move on to exploration. Okay, so this is part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the types of questions that I mentioned here earlier. And if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions, like predictive and prescriptive, then we must start using advanced analytical tools, such as machine learning tools, that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future. Now, once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics, what do we do next? Well, we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis. Okay, now I want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle. So in an organization, you may have roles like a business analyst, you might have data engineers, and then you might have data scientists. So business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions. They have the domain expertise, they can help with the business understanding. But they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business, right? And then we have folks like data engineering folks. So these are the people that can help us find the data, clean the data, and then also help with some of the exploration. Next, we move on to our data scientists. So these are the people that will really help us with the exploration, they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques, and they'll also assist in the visualization. So you can see there's some overlap between the roles, and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles. And what you'll also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning, they have to help out with exploration. Data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own. So there's a lot of overlap, and these different roles must collaborate with each other. Okay, so I hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data, turn it into knowledge and insights, and then turn it into meaningful action for our business. Thank you.\", '_58RKPXiORA': \" There are two ways by which energy is capable of moving. One of these ways is known as heat and that's what we're going to discuss in this lecture. So if two objects that are at different temperatures are brought in contact with one another, energy will begin to flow from the hotter object to the cooler object until thermal equilibrium is established. Thermal equilibrium simply means that the two objects which were initially at two different temperatures have reached the same temperature. So thermal equilibrium has been reached. So let's suppose we have the following two objects, object number one and object number two. Now object number one is initially at a higher temperature than object number two. So initially the two objects are separated by some distance d. So now let's suppose I take my two objects and I bring them in contact. So I decrease my distance to zero. So now my objects are in contact and energy will begin to flow from the hotter object from the object with the higher temperature to the cooler object to the object with the lower temperature and this energy transfer will continue to take place until thermal equilibrium is reached until they reach the same exact temperature at which point energy will stop flowing. So we define heat as the transfer of energy that takes place as a result of a difference in temperature between two or more objects. And heat continues until thermal equilibrium is reached. So let's look at a few important units. So we define something known as a calorie with a lower case c as the amount of energy that is required to increase the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius from fourteen point five degrees to fifteen point five degrees. We also define something known as a calorie with an upper case c as the amount of energy that is required to increase the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius also from fourteen point five to fifteen point five degrees Celsius. So that means one or one thousand calories is equal to one calorie with the upper case c. So one thousand calories is simply one kilocalorie. So because energy is very commonly defined in terms of joules we have to also talk about the conversion from calories to joules. So it turns out that one calorie with a lower case c is equal to four point one eight six joules of energy and one kilocalorie is equivalent to four point one eight six kilojoules of energy. So that means that it takes four point one eight six joules of energy to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. So let's quickly look at the following example in which we're going to utilize this concept of energy transfer. Suppose you eat food that contains one thousand calories of energy where the calories is given with the upper case c. Calculate the vertical distance that you have to climb if you wish to burn those calories. Assume that the mass, your mass, is eighty five kilograms. So let's suppose we ingest the food and our body breaks down that food. Now if we don't actually physically exercise our body will store that food in macromolecules such as carbohydrates and fats. So we want to find out the vertical distance that we have to climb, let's say via staircase, if we wish to burn all those one thousand calories. So first we have to convert calories to joules of energy. So one thousand calories with the capital C is equivalent to one thousand times four point one eight six kilojoules. So that equals four thousand one hundred and eighty six kilojoules of energy is equivalent to one thousand calories with the capital C. Now that is also equivalent to four million one hundred and eighty six thousand joules of energy. Recall that work is equal to m times g times h where m is the mass of the object in motion the person, g is the gravitational constant and h is our height, it's the change in potential. So we want to find what this h is. So we multiply the mass eighty five kilograms by the g nine point eight meters per second squared then we divide both sides by that value and we get our height. So the work is equal to this amount of energy so we have four million one hundred and eighty six thousand joules of energy divided by the product of eighty and nine point eight and that gives us the height. So the height is about five thousand three hundred meters. So that is about twelve times the height of the Empire State Building.\", 'd5zH2RdR1qQ': \" Let's briefly review Lewis structures now and talk about the shorthand that organic chemists use to represent Lewis structures containing a large number of atoms and a good deal of structural complexity. So let's return to the idea of drawing Lewis structures. The first thing I want to say about this is that this is really a process, not an algorithm. If you got the idea from introductory chemistry that drawing Lewis structures based on a formula is, for example, a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at the same Lewis structure, hate to break it to you, but you got the wrong idea. This is more of a process. It's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a Lewis structure. Where the error generally tends to lie is in the first step, which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton. The sigma skeleton shows how the atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds. The sigma skeleton consumes or uses up the sigma electrons in the molecule. The question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good question, and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this. In general, we find less electronegative atoms near the center of Lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds. They have a higher what's called valence, and so we find near the center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence. We can use the way the formula is written as a guide, and you'll start recognizing patterns here. Patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogens bound to a carbon, NO2 indicating two oxygens bound to nitrogen, and even patterns in the way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group. Once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down, we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to the structure until we've satisfied the octet rule and all the valence electrons are used up. So here, for example, we might add a lone pair to this atom, a multiple bond here, maybe a triple bond here, something like this, until we've satisfied the octet rule on every atom and all the valence electrons are used up. And what this means is that the total valence electron count for all of the atoms in the structure is equal to the sum of the sigma electrons, the electrons in the sigma skeleton, and the pi and non-bonding electrons that we find in lone pairs and pi bonds. We then add formal charges based on the formal electron count of each atom relative to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. We'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video. And then finally, we check that the total number of electrons really is equal to the sum of the valence electron counts of all the atoms, and, and this is an important piece that's not on the slide, we also need to consider the overall charge of the molecule in counting up the number of valence electrons. If the charge is negative, we need to add electrons, and if it's positive, we need to take electrons away. So considering the overall charge is very important here as well. This last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in the reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one, if needed, to generate a new sigma skeleton. So really you should think about drawing Lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to the end, you want to evaluate, is the octet rule satisfied, does the structure make sense, and is the structure reasonable? And quite often, you'll need to do this evaluation on Lewis structures that you're looking at or that you've drawn yourself based on given Lewis structures, not for the molecule as a whole, but for specific regions of interest within a molecule, and so this evaluation or this check is really important, particularly for shorthand, which we'll move to in the second half of this video. We alluded to this already, but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in Lewis structures depending on the concept or idea that we're working with. We're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes, the so-called formal electron count, which is used to deal with formal charge, and the so-called total electron count, which is used to assess the octet rule. The formal electron count is defined as the formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing, and by equal sharing, we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms, let's say A and B, and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count the electrons this way. So in this hypothetical molecule, A has one electron, B has one electron, so we don't double count. To determine the total electron count around an atom, we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice, so we take AB and we imagine A has a pair of electrons and B has a pair of electrons. Now, it seems like electrons have come out of thin air, but for the purposes of the octet rule, it's okay to double count electrons like this. So as an example, we can look at the formal electron count in the ammonium ion to calculate formal charge. We think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons, one each from its four bonds to the hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each. So what we do to generate the formal electron count is we split those bonds in half, giving one electron to each of the atoms involved, and then we compare the electron count of each atom to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. If you examine the periodic table, you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons. It's in group 15, and here the nitrogen has four, and so its formal charge here is plus one, because it has one fewer electron in this structure than the neutral atom does. Each of the hydrogens has one valence electron, and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron, and so the charges on the hydrogens are zero, and we typically don't represent this using anything special. We just leave a charge off, and so the molecule as a whole would be drawn with the formal charge near the nitrogen atom, something like this. The total electron count is used to assess the octet rule. In other words, it's used to evaluate whether the octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure. So in applying this analysis to ammonium, we're actually going to give two electrons to the central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at the number of electrons around the nitrogen to determine the so-called total electron count, and we're going to do the same thing with the hydrogens, giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for the purposes of total electron count. So if we focus on the nitrogen, what we find now is that the total electron count is eight, and each of the hydrogens has a total electron count of two, and so while the nitrogen is obeying the octet rule, the hydrogens are actually exceptions to the octet rule, and we'll talk more about the octet rule and its exceptions here in a second. The octet rule says that the total electron count, as we defined it on the last slide, tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures. There are a few important exceptions to the octet rule, and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight. Recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons, one of which I'm going to touch on on this slide. So the first is hydrogen, and we've seen this already. Hydrogen tends to form only one bond. In fact, in all of the structures we'll see in this course, hydrogen forms one and only one bond, and so its total electron count from the perspective of the TEc, as we defined it on the last slide, is only two. This is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row element. It only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell. Neutral group 13 atoms are another famous case of exception to the octet rule, and these have six total electrons according to our convention. So the classic examples are, for example, boron and aluminum. Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight, sometimes, not always. So sulfur, for example, and sulfuric acid is a nice example of this. If we decompose the sulfuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron count, what we find is that the sulfur has two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve electrons around it. Count the total number of bonds here. One, two, three, four, five, six times two is a total electron count of twelve, and that is a crazy violation of the octet rule, but for third-row elements in below, this is okay. The last example I'll mention is carbocation and carbenes, important intermediates in organic chemistry. These are actually analogous to the group 13 elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lesson, but these have six electrons around a carbon atom, either with positive charge, and this is isoelectronic to the group 13 boranes and aluminum compounds, and the carbene is a carbon with four formal electrons, four electrons in terms of valence electron count, but only two bonds. An important thing to note about these species, the atoms with six total electrons, such as the carbocation, carbene, and the group 13 atoms, is that these are often reactive, and they're often reactive in the sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto the atom with only six total electrons on it, so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms. That reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in the semester.\", '3vy__KvTi6I': \" Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of the many different types of biological reactions and biological processes that take place in nature. Now, the majority of the different types of biological reactions that exist in nature, for example in our body and inside the cells of our body, they exist in water. So water is the natural solvent. It's the solvent that allows all these different types of biological reactions to actually take place in the first place. And because of the properties of water, as we'll see in just a moment, we'll see what these properties are, the fact that water is a solvent allows those reactions to follow a certain pathway. And water also actually helps determine what the final structure is of these biological molecules. For example, one biochemical process in our body, inside the cells of our body, is the biosynthesis of proteins. And as a result of the properties of water, that protein is able to actually obtain its final three-dimensional shape. And we'll discuss that in much more detail in a future lecture. In this lecture, we're going to focus on two important properties of water and we're going to see how these two properties lead to an effect known as the hydrophobic effect. So let's begin by discussing property number one, the fact that water is a polar molecule. It contains an electric dipole moment. Now, a single water molecule consists of three individual atoms. We have the central oxygen atom, which is a large molecule, and the two tiny H atoms found on the side. Now, water is not a linear molecule. It has a bent shape. And what that means is these bonds create a certain angle that is not 180 degrees. So notice the bent shape of the H2O molecule. Now, oxygen is much more electronegative than either of these H atoms. And because of that, oxygen is able to pull that electron density away from these two H atoms. And because it is much more likely that the electron density will be found around the oxygen than around the H atoms, and at any given moment in time, that oxygen atom will have a partial negative charge and the two H atoms will be deficient of the electron density. And so they will have a partial positive charge. Now, from physics, we know that whenever we have the separation of two opposite charges, whenever a positive charge is separated from a negative charge by a certain distance, there will exist an electric dipole moment as a result of that separation of charge. So what does that mean about this water molecule here? So basically, we have this partial positive charge that is a certain distance, this distance here, away from this partial negative charge. And so from physics, we know there will be an electric dipole moment that will exist and will point in the following general direction. Now, likewise, we have a separation of charge between these two charges. And so there will be an electric dipole moment that points in this direction. So what that means is we have these two electric dipole moments that point this way. And if we add up these two vectors, then the net result will be a vector, an electric dipole moment, that will point beginning here and will point this way, as shown by the following green arrow. So this green arrow basically describes the direction of our net electric dipole moment of this water molecule. So the fact that water is polar simply means it has an electric dipole moment. And what that means is there is an unequal and asymmetric distribution of electron density. And that gives the oxygen a partial negative charge and these H atoms a partial positive charge. Now, let's move on to the second property of water, its ability to basically form strong intermolecular bonds with other water molecules. And as we'll see in just a moment, with other polar molecules as well. So let's suppose we have several water molecules that are in close proximity. How exactly will these water molecules actually orient themselves with respect to one another? And how will they interact with one another? Well, as a result of the fact that water is polar, it will have a partial positive charge on the oxygen. And so we draw the oxygen with a blue sphere. So the blue sphere basically designates our partially negative oxygen, while these red spheres designate the partially positive H atoms. And so if we have these 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 water molecules in close proximity, they will orient themselves with respect to one another in such a way to basically maximize the amount of electric interactions. They're actually electromagnetic, but we can say electric interactions between the different atoms on different molecules. So because these H atoms have a partially positive charge, they will be attracted to the partially negative oxygen atoms. And so if we look at these two water molecules, for example, this H atom of this water molecule will try to get as close as possible to this partially negative oxygen atom. And this bond is known as an intermolecular bond. Now, the specific type of intermolecular bond in this case is a hydrogen bond. So any time we have the H atom bonding with some type of negative charge, that is a hydrogen bond. Now, what's so special about a hydrogen bond? Well, a hydrogen bond is a very strong intermolecular bond, and that's because of the tiny size of that H atom. So remember, H atoms are the smallest types of atoms in nature, the smallest type of nucleus is the nucleus of an H atom. And so what that means is this H atom, because it's so small, it can actually get very close to that oxygen atom. And if it gets very close, the distance decreases. And we know that our electric force is directly proportional or inversely proportional to the square of the distance between our two charges. And so because the distance here will be so small, if the distance is small, the force will become large. And if the force is large, this interaction is very strong. And this type of interaction between the H atom of one water molecule and the oxygen atom of another water molecule is known as a hydrogen bond. So once again, water molecules interact strongly with other water molecules via electrical forces or to be more specific, electromagnetic forces. Now, the small size of the positively charged hydrogen atom of one molecule, for example, let's say this molecule, allows it to get very close to the negatively charged oxygen of another molecule, for example, this molecule right here. The small size of this allows it to get very close to this oxygen. And this small distance basically means we have a very strong interaction. And this type of strong intermolecular interaction or intermolecular bond is known as a hydrogen bond. So we see the fact that water is a polar molecule. And because it consists of these very tiny H atoms, we form these very strong intermolecular bonds known as hydrogen bonds when when many of these water molecules actually are found in close proximity. Now, these two properties lead directly into something called the hydrophobic effect. So the hydrophobic effect is a manifestation of these two properties, as we'll see in just a moment. And the hydrophobic effect plays an important role in the field of biochemistry. So let's suppose we take water molecules and we place some type of polar substance into the water molecule, for example, sodium chloride. Now, sodium chloride is polar because it consists of an ionic bond. And an ionic bond is basically a bond in which we have an unequal distribution of charge. So one of the atoms, one of the atoms, namely the chloride, is more electronegative. So it will have that full negative charge. But the sodium is not very electronegative and it will give away those electrons. And so it will have a positive charge. And so if we place the sodium chloride into water, that sodium chloride will separate, that ionic bond will break. But many of these hydrogen bonds will form and that will be a favorable reaction. And so that's exactly why if we take a polar molecule or a polar substance and place it into water, the water will be able to dissociate and dissolve that substance because of these hydrogen bonds. So due to the high polarity of water and its ability to hydrogen bond, water can readily dissolve other polar substances. For instance, by adding sodium chloride into water, we break the ionic bond between sodium and the chloride. And we form many individual hydrogen bonds and this is a very favorable reaction. For example, let's say we form one, two, three, four, five of these hydrogen bonds between sodium and water. And we form all these bonds between chloride and water. So even though we break that sodium chloride bond, we form many of these hydrogen bonds. And that is overall a favorable reaction. So notice that because the sodium loses that electron, it gains a full positive charge. And so all these oxygen atoms of the water molecules orient themselves in a line in such a way so that the oxygen is in close proximity with the sodium. And if we examine the chloride, because the chloride gained that electron, it took away from the sodium. It has a full negative charge. And so now all the H atoms will orient themselves and will become very close with that chloride. And that will form all these stabilizing hydrogen bonds. Now, we know that polar dissolves polar as a result of this. But what happens if we take water and we place a single non-polar molecule into that water? What exactly will happen then? Well, non-polar substances basically have very little or no polarity. And what that means is polar substances, non-polar substances, have a symmetric distribution of charge. And so they will not show an electric dipole moment like water does. So non-polar substances have no polarity and do not interact favorably with water because if they don't have an unequal separation of charge, that means they cannot form these relatively strong hydrogen bonds. And so if we take a single non-polar molecule and we place it into water, what will happen is all these water molecules will essentially form a cage around the non-polar molecule. And that is not a stabilizing effect because all these water molecules will essentially be fixed. They will be trapped around that non-polar molecule. And these water molecules will not be able to interact favorably with other water molecules. So when a non-polar substance is added to water, the water molecules form a cage around that non-polar molecule as shown in this diagram. This is not a favorable effect because it limits those water molecules. It traps those water molecules around the non-polar substance and it limits the amount of hydrogen bonds that can form between these water molecules. And that is not a favorable effect. Now, what happens if instead of taking one non-polar substance, we take two non-polar molecules and place it into our water? What will happen now? Well, the same exact thing will happen at first. Initially what happens is once we place the two non-polar molecules into water, those water molecules will form a cage effect. They will become trapped around the non-polar substance. And that is not a favorable process. So what actually happens is these two non-polar molecules will aggregate. They will essentially combine and form bonds. And the reason for that is when this process takes place, we basically decrease the number of trapped molecules found around the non-polar substance. So in this particular case, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. So we have 22 of these water molecules that are trapped around these non-polar molecules. And because they are trapped, they cannot interact via these hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. But if these two non-polar substances actually aggregate together, they will decrease the amount of surface area around this entire molecule. And instead of having these 22 water molecules that are trapped, we only have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of these water molecules that will be trapped. And that is a favorable reaction because we basically decrease the amount of water molecules that are trapped. And so we increase the amount of water molecules that can actually form those hydrogen bonds that are stabilizing. And this interaction between the non-polar molecules in a polar solvent such as water is known as a hydrophobic interaction. And this effect is known as the hydrophobic effect. And it is a result of the fact that water is a polar molecule and it forms these strong intermolecular bonds we call hydrogen bonds. So once again, if two or more non-polar molecules are added into water, our solvent, the non-polar molecules will aggregate together. And this is favorable because it releases those trapped molecules.\"}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install textblob pandas wordcloud nltk matplotlib seaborn\n","import

So let's return to the idea of drawing Lewis structures. The first thing I want to say about this is that this is really a process, not an algorithm. If you got the idea from introductory chemistry that drawing Lewis structures based on a formula is, for example, a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at the same Lewis structure, hate to break it to you, but you got the wrong idea. This is more of a process. It's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a Lewis structure. Where the error generally tends to lie is in the first step, which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton. The sigma skeleton shows how the atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds. The sigma skeleton consumes or uses up the sigma electrons in the molecule. The question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good question, and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this. In general, we find less electronegative atoms near the center of Lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds. They have a higher what's called valence, and so we find near the center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence. We can use the way the formula is written as a guide, and you'll start recognizing patterns here. Patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogens bound to a carbon, NO2 indicating two oxygens bound to nitrogen, and even patterns in the way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group. Once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down, we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to the structure until we've satisfied the octet rule and all the valence electrons are used up. So here, for example, we might add a lone pair to this atom, a multiple bond here, maybe a triple bond here, something like this, until we've satisfied the octet rule on every atom and all the valence electrons are used up. And what this means is that the total valence electron count for all of the atoms in the structure is equal to the sum of the sigma electrons, the electrons in the sigma skeleton, and the pi and non-bonding electrons that we find in lone pairs and pi bonds. We then add formal charges based on the formal electron count of each atom relative to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. We'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video. And then finally, we check that the total number of electrons really is equal to the sum of the valence electron counts of all the atoms, and, and this is an important piece that's not on the slide, we also need to consider the overall charge of the molecule in counting up the number of valence electrons. If the charge is negative, we need to add electrons, and if it's positive, we need to take electrons away. So considering the overall charge is very important here as well. This last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in the reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one, if needed, to generate a new sigma skeleton. So really you should think about drawing Lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to the end, you want to evaluate, is the octet rule satisfied, does the structure make sense, and is the structure reasonable? And quite often, you'll need to do this evaluation on Lewis structures that you're looking at or that you've drawn yourself based on given Lewis structures, not for the molecule as a whole, but for specific regions of interest within a molecule, and so this evaluation or this check is really important, particularly for shorthand, which we'll move to in the second half of this video. We alluded to this already, but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in Lewis structures depending on the concept or idea that we're working with. We're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes, the so-called formal electron count, which is used to deal with formal charge, and the so-called total electron count, which is used to assess the octet rule. The formal electron count is defined as the formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing, and by equal sharing, we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms, let's say A and B, and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count the electrons this way. So in this hypothetical molecule, A has one electron, B has one electron, so we don't double count. To determine the total electron count around an atom, we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice, so we take AB and we imagine A has a pair of electrons and B has a pair of electrons. Now, it seems like electrons have come out of thin air, but for the purposes of the octet rule, it's okay to double count electrons like this. So as an example, we can look at the formal electron count in the ammonium ion to calculate formal charge. We think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons, one each from its four bonds to the hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each. So what we do to generate the formal electron count is we split those bonds in half, giving one electron to each of the atoms involved, and then we compare the electron count of each atom to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. If you examine the periodic table, you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons. It's in group 15, and here the nitrogen has four, and so its formal charge here is plus one, because it has one fewer electron in this structure than the neutral atom does. Each of the hydrogens has one valence electron, and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron, and so the charges on the hydrogens are zero, and we typically don't represent this using anything special. We just leave a charge off, and so the molecule as a whole would be drawn with the formal charge near the nitrogen atom, something like this. The total electron count is used to assess the octet rule. In other words, it's used to evaluate whether the octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure. So in applying this analysis to ammonium, we're actually going to give two electrons to the central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at the number of electrons around the nitrogen to determine the so-called total electron count, and we're going to do the same thing with the hydrogens, giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for the purposes of total electron count. So if we focus on the nitrogen, what we find now is that the total electron count is eight, and each of the hydrogens has a total electron count of two, and so while the nitrogen is obeying the octet rule, the hydrogens are actually exceptions to the octet rule, and we'll talk more about the octet rule and its exceptions here in a second. The octet rule says that the total electron count, as we defined it on the last slide, tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures. There are a few important exceptions to the octet rule, and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight. Recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons, one of which I'm going to touch on on this slide. So the first is hydrogen, and we've seen this already. Hydrogen tends to form only one bond. In fact, in all of the structures we'll see in this course, hydrogen forms one and only one bond, and so its total electron count from the perspective of the TEc, as we defined it on the last slide, is only two. This is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row element. It only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell. Neutral group 13 atoms are another famous case of exception to the octet rule, and these have six total electrons according to our convention. So the classic examples are, for example, boron and aluminum. Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight, sometimes, not always. So sulfur, for example, and sulfuric acid is a nice example of this. If we decompose the sulfuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron count, what we find is that the sulfur has two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve electrons around it. Count the total number of bonds here. One, two, three, four, five, six times two is a total electron count of twelve, and that is a crazy violation of the octet rule, but for third-row elements in below, this is okay. The last example I'll mention is carbocation and carbenes, important intermediates in organic chemistry. These are actually analogous to the group 13 elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lesson, but these have six electrons around a carbon atom, either with positive charge, and this is isoelectronic to the group 13 boranes and aluminum compounds, and the carbene is a carbon with four formal electrons, four electrons in terms of valence electron count, but only two bonds. An important thing to note about these species, the atoms with six total electrons, such as the carbocation, carbene, and the group 13 atoms, is that these are often reactive, and they're often reactive in the sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto the atom with only six total electrons on it, so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms. That reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in the semester.\",\n          \" Hi, I'm Professor Akshar at Glendale Community College. This is Physics 101, Lecture 1. In this lecture, we'll discuss units and dimensions. These topics are covered in Chapter 1 of our textbook by Surway and Jouette. Physics is ultimately an experimental science, and as such, we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature. To perform those measurements, we need standards of measurement, or units for our measurements. The three quantities that we will want to measure most often, at least in this class, are length, time, and mass. To measure these three quantities, we will use the International System of Units, which is also known as the SI system. The abbreviation SI refers to the French designation Syst\\u00e8me International. Using the SI system of units, we'll use the meter to measure length, we'll use the second to measure time, and the kilogram to measure mass. The meter and the kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you, hopefully all of you are familiar with the second, but by the end of this semester, you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is. The experimental work that we'll do in the laboratory section of this class should help you with that. In our study of mechanics in this class, we will encounter other units in addition to the meter, the second, and the kilogram. However, any other unit that we encounter, at least in this class, can be represented or expressed in terms of the three base units, the meter, the second, and the kilogram. For example, later in the semester when we study forces, we'll find that the SI unit for force is the newton, and the newton can be expressed in terms of meters, seconds, and kilograms as shown here. So although the newton seems like a new unit, it really is just a combination of the kilogram times the meter divided by second squared. A little bit later, we'll talk about energy in this class, and we'll find that the SI unit for energy is the joule, and the joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared. Shortly after that, we'll talk about power, and we'll learn that the SI unit of power is the watt, and the watt is simply the kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed. At this point, it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from, and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force, energy, and power are. The important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well, because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units. Now, for the sake of completeness, I should mention that there are other base units in physics. It turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units. In this class, we're primarily interested in the meter, which measures length or distance, the second, which measures time or duration. We're interested in the kilogram, which measures mass. But if you go on in physics and engineering, you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature. The SI base unit for measuring temperature is the Kelvin. If you take a course on electricity, magnetism, or circuits, you will want to measure the electric current, and that is measured in amperes. If you've ever taken a course on chemistry, you have probably encountered the mole, which measures the amount of substance. If you want to measure luminous intensity, one would use the candela as the SI base unit. We're really only going to use the first three, but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here. We will need to convert between SI and non-SI units. Primarily, we're interested in SI units. That's our preferred system of measurement. But in different applications, you will inevitably encounter non-SI units, and it's important to know how to go back and forth between the SI and the non-SI units. This table here shows a variety of SI units on the left and non-SI units on the right. Some of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized. You should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimeters. In fact, the prefix centi basically means one one hundredth. So when we talk about a centimeter, we're talking about one hundredth of a meter. Therefore, there are a hundred centimeters to a meter. One meter is equal to 3.281 feet. One meter is also equal to 39.37 inches. A thousand meters is referred to as a kilometer. The prefix kilo means a thousand. So a kilometer or a kilometer is a thousand meters. A mile is approximately 1609 meters. A minute is 60 seconds. An hour is 60 minutes, and each minute is 60 seconds. So 60 times 60 is 3600 seconds to an hour. One kilogram is a thousand grams. A kilogram is also approximately 35 ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds. You don't need to memorize all of these, but some of them, the ones that are in blue, the ones that I've indicated here in this third or last column, are the ones that you should memorize. These are common enough that you will encounter them frequently, and you should know what these conversion factors are off the top of your head. The other conversion factors, the ones that are in black font, are not so important to memorize. It's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are. On an exam, I would probably give you the conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it. Whenever you report the result of a measurement, you should report the units that you used for that measurement, along with the number. That way, the person that is reading your report knows how to interpret the results of your measurement. Units are important in their own right, but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units. Keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations. Keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations. Keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's the right formula for a particular quantity. For example, later in the semester, we will encounter the centripetal force. At this point, it may not be obvious what the centripetal force is. That's not so important. We'll discuss it at length and I'll give you the right formula for it. At some point, you might forget exactly what the formula for centripetal force is. By the end of this semester, you will have encountered hundreds of formulas. On the final exam, you might forget whether the centripetal force is mv divided by r or mv squared over r. In this context, m stands for mass, v stands for velocity or speed, and r is simply distance. Again, we'll talk about all this in much more detail later, but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether the right formula is mv over r or mv squared over r. It turns out if you're paying attention to the units, you can actually figure out which one of these two, the one on the left or the one on the right, is the correct formula. If you have an equation and it's a valid equation, then numerically the left side must equal to the right side, but you want the units to also match. In other words, you want the units of measurement for whatever appears on the left side of the equation to match the units for whatever appears on the right side of the equation. For both of these equations, the left side represents force, as we'll see later, the SI unit for force is the Newton, and a Newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared. I've used the square bracket here. The square bracket indicates the units of. So when I put square brackets around the quantity, I'm not really referring to the value of that quantity. Instead, I'm referring to the unit for that quantity. Now let's look at this formula here on the left. The claim is that force is equal to mv over r. What are the SI units of mv over r? Well, if m is mass, then it's measured in kilograms. V is speed, so it's measured in meters per second, and r is a distance, and that's measured in meters. You can cancel the meter that you see in the denominator here with the one that you see in the numerator, and this reduces to simply kilograms per second. You can already see that this is not a good match. What we have for force is this quantity here, a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared, and what we have for mv over r is this unit. This set of units obviously does not match this set of units, so this is an indication that this formula is wrong. On the other hand, our other formula says force is equal to mv squared over r. The square brackets again indicate the units of mv squared over r. m is kilograms, v is speed. We're going to measure that in meters per second, but it's speed squared, so it's going to be meter squared per second squared, and r is distance, so that's going to be measured in meters. You can see that this m here cancels one copy of the m in the denominator, so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared, and these units match exactly the units for force, or a newton basically. If I'm trying to decide between these two formulas, I can now tell you that the one on the left must be incorrect and the one on the right must be correct. This is not a proof that the formula is correct. However, if you know one of these formulas, then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is the correct one and which one is the incorrect one. As I mentioned earlier, we have to know how to convert between Si and non-Si units. Sometimes these conversions can get complicated, so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions. The method that we want to use in this class is known as the factor-label method. I'll demonstrate the factor-label method using an example problem. The peregrine falcon, considered the fastest animal on earth, has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hour. What is the speed in Si units? So here we've specified the units, but the units are not the same as the units on the left. We've specified the units for speed as miles per hour. Miles and hours are not Si units. If we want to convert to Si units, we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds. So we'll need two conversion factors for this process. Looking through your textbook or perhaps the internet, you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hour. You should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters. And you should know off the top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds. You should also know the following fact from algebra. This is simply a mathematical fact that if A is equal to B, then A over B is equal to 1. It doesn't matter what A and B are, if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other, as shown here, you can divide both sides of this equation by B and show that A divided by B is equal to 1. Why is this fact important to us here? Well, it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, then the ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to 1. So if a quantity on the left is equal to a quantity on the right, I can divide both sides by, let's say, one hour, and what I'll get is 1. This is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply the speed of this falcon by 1. And multiplying by 1, of course, does not change the quantity, so it's a mathematically permissible process. More precisely, this is what I mean. If you want to convert something using the factor-label method, you write the quantity first, and make sure you write the units down as well, miles per hour, then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert. I want to do two conversions, miles and hours, so I'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here. I know that 1,609 meters is equal to 1 miles, so when I write it as a ratio, I'm really just writing 1. I also know that 1 hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, so when I divide 1 hour by 3,600 seconds, I'm getting 1. Which means basically I'm multiplying the number 242 by 1, and then by 1 again. Now notice how I've written these ratios out. I've chosen to write the mile in the denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this mile. I've also written the 3,600 seconds in the denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have the hours cancel out. So if you look at this product, you'll see that miles here cancels miles here, and hours here cancels hours here, and what we're left with is meters and seconds, which is exactly the same as the number 242. So I can put everything into my calculator. 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second. That's the speed of the Falcon in SI units. Here's another example for you to consider. We have a cylinder. The cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and the base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet. The base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of 6 feet. Calculate the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet. Notice these quantities, these dimensions here are given to you in feet, so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of the problem. We do need to know what the formula for the volume of the cylinder is. Hopefully you remember that. To calculate the volume of the cylinder, you must calculate the base or the top of the cylinder, which is simply pi r squared, and then you multiply that by the height of the cylinder. So now I can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by 6 and don't forget pi. When I put all this into my calculator, I find that the volume of the cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet. It should make sense that the volume is cubic feet because after all I've taken the radius, which was measured in feet and I've squared it, so that's feet squared and then I've multiplied it by the height, so that's a third copy of the same unit, so I end up with cubic feet here. Now let us convert this volume to SI units. What we want to do is convert feet to meters. Looking at your book, you will find that 1 meter is approximately 3 feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet. So now what I can do is I can go back and convert the radius to meters. I can also convert the height to meters and then I can take those converted numbers, plug them into this formula, use the formula one more time and calculate the volume in cubic meters. However, there is another way of doing it. Rather than using this formula one more time, I can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters. If I'm going to do the foot to meter conversion, I need to remember that this is feet cubed so I need three conversion factors. So here I've written 1 meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and I've done it three times and by doing it that way I've made sure that cubic feet here gets canceled by feet, feet and feet here and then what I'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly the SI unit for volume. Now I can put all this into my calculator, I can simply divide it by 3 divided by 3 or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and the final answer is 3.336 cubic meters. And that is the end of this lecture. Thank you for your attention.\",\n          \" So here is something funny. You might say, OK, what is simpler, a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear? And the answer, of course, a linear theory is much simpler. Maxwell's equations are linear. Einstein's theory of relativity is very nonlinear, very complicated. How about classical mechanics? Is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear? What do we think? Can't hear anyone. Linear, OK. You may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple, but it's not. This actually is very nonlinear. Newton could solve the two-body problem, but he couldn't solve the three-body problem. Already with three bodies, you cannot superpose solutions that you get with two bodies. It's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics. Let me show you. If you have motion in one dimension, in 1D, you have the equation of motion, motion in one dimension under a potential v of x that is time independent, a particle moving in one dimension, x with under the influence of a potential v of x. The second, the dynamical variable is x of t, the dynamical variable. And the equation of motion is, so let me explain this. This is force equal mass times acceleration. This is mass. This is acceleration, the second derivative of the position. And v force is minus the derivative of the potential evaluated at the position. Derivatives of potentials, if you think of a potential, the derivative of the potential is here positive. And you know you have a mass here. It tends to go to the left. So the force is on the left. So it's minus. So v prime is the derivative of v with respect to its argument. And the problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operation, if you take two derivatives of a sum of things, you take two derivatives of the first plus two derivatives of the second. But yes, this side is linear. But this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary. And the derivative, so suppose the potential is cubic in x. v of x goes like x cubed. Then the derivative of v goes like x squared. And x squared is not a linear function. So this Newton's equation is not a linear equation. And therefore, it's complicated to solve, very complicated to solve. So finally, we get to our case, quantum mechanics. So in quantum mechanics, what do we have? In quantum mechanics, it's linear. First, you need an equation. And whose equation is it? Schrodinger's equation, 1925. He writes an equation for the dynamical variable. And the dynamical variable is something called the wave function. This wave function can depend on t, depends on time. And it may depend on other things as well. And it describes the dynamics of the quantum system as it evolves in time. There is the wave function. And you have an equation for this wave function. And what is the equation for this wave function? It's a universal equation. i h bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to h hat psi, where h hat is called the Hamiltonian. And it's a linear operator. That's why I had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is. This is the general structure of the Schrodinger equation. It's a time derivative and a linear operator. So if you wish to write the Schrodinger equation as an L psi equals 0, then L psi would be defined as i h bar d dt of psi minus h hat psi. Then this is the Schrodinger equation. This equation here, Schrodinger equation. And as you can see, it's a linear equation. You can check it. Check that L is a linear operator. Therefore, it is naturally linear. You can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operation. If you have the d dt of a number times a function, the number goes out. You differentiate the function. d dt of the sum of two functions, you differentiate the first, you differentiate it. So this is linear. And h, we said, is linear. So L is going to be linear. And the Schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation. And therefore, you're going to have the great advantage that any time you find solutions, you can scale them. You can add them. You can put them together, combine them in superpositions, and find new solutions. So in that sense, it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics. And in fact, you will see throughout this semester how the mathematics and the things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics, are more elegant, more beautiful, more coherent. It's simpler and very nice. i is the square root of minus 1, is the imaginary unit. And that's what we're going to talk next on the necessity of complex numbers. h bar, yes, it's a number. It shows up in quantum mechanics early on. It's called Planck's constant. And it began when Planck tried to fit the black-body spectrum. And he found the need to put a constant in there. And then later, Einstein figured out that it was very relevant. So yes, it's a number. For any physical system that you have, you will have a wave function. And you will have a Hamiltonian. And the Hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover. So if you have a particle moving on a line, the wave function will depend on time and on x. If you have a particle moving in three dimensions, it will depend on x vector. It may depend on other things as well. Or it may be like one particle has several wave functions. And that happens when you have a particle with spin. So in general, always time, sometimes position. There may be cases where it doesn't depend on position. You think of an electron at some point in space. And it's fixed. You lock it there. And you want to understand the physics of that electron locked into place. And then position is not relevant. So what it does with its spin is relevant. And then you may need more than one wave function. What is one describing the spin up and one describing the spin down? So it was funny that Schrodinger wrote this equation. And when asked, so what is the wave function, he said, I don't know. No physical interpretation for the wave function was obvious for the people that invented quantum mechanics. It took a few months until Max Born said it has to do with probabilities. And that's what we're going to get next. So our next point is the necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

\"samples\": [\n          \"let's briefly review lewis structures now and talk about \\ufeffthe shorthand that organic chemists use to represent lewis structures containing a large number of atoms and a good deal of structural complexity to let's return to \\ufeffthe idea of drawing lewis structures he first thing a want to say about this is that this is really a process not an algorithm of you got \\ufeffthe idea from introductory chemistry that drawing lewis structures based on a formula is for example a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at \\ufeffthe same lewis structure hate to break it to you but you got \\ufeffthe wrong ideas this is more of a process it's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a lewis structure there \\ufeffthe error generally tends to lie is in \\ufeffthe first step which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton he sigma skeleton shows how \\ufeffthe atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds he sigma skeleton consumes or uses up \\ufeffthe sigma electrons in \\ufeffthe molecules he question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good questions and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this in general we find less electronegative atoms near \\ufeffthe center of lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds they have a higher what's called valence and so we find near \\ufeffthe center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence be can use \\ufeffthe way \\ufeffthe formula is written as a guide and you'll start recognizing patterns here patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogen bound to a carbon NO2 indicating two oxygen bound to nitrogen and even patterns in \\ufeffthe way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to \\ufeffthe structure until we've satisfied \\ufeffthe octet rule and all \\ufeffthe valence electrons are used up to here for example we might add a lone pair to this atom a multiple bond here maybe a triple bond here something like this until we've satisfied \\ufeffthe octet rule on every atom and all \\ufeffthe valence electrons are used up and what this means is that \\ufeffthe total valence electron count for all of \\ufeffthe atoms in \\ufeffthe structure is equal to \\ufeffthe sum of \\ufeffthe sigma electrons \\ufeffthe electrons in \\ufeffthe sigma skeleton and \\ufeffthe i and nonbinding electrons that we find in lone pairs and i bonds be then add formal charges based on \\ufeffthe formal electron count of each atom relative to \\ufeffthe valence electron count of \\ufeffthe neutral atom we'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video and then finally we check that \\ufeffthe total number of electrons really is equal to \\ufeffthe sum of \\ufeffthe valence electron counts of all \\ufeffthe atoms and and this is an important piece that's not on \\ufeffthe slide we also need to consider \\ufeffthe overall charge of \\ufeffthe molecule in counting up \\ufeffthe number of valence electrons of \\ufeffthe charge is negative we need to add electrons and if it's positive we need to take electrons away to considering \\ufeffthe overall charge is very important here as well this last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in \\ufeffthe reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one if needed to generate a new sigma skeleton to really you should think about drawing lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to \\ufeffthe end you want to evaluate is \\ufeffthe octet rule satisfied does \\ufeffthe structure make sense and is \\ufeffthe structure reasonable and quite often you'll need to do this evaluation on lewis structures that you're looking at or that you're drawn yourself based on given lewis structures not for \\ufeffthe molecule as a whole but for specific regions of interest within a molecules and so this evaluation or this check is really important particularly for shorthand which we'll move to in \\ufeffthe second half of this video be alluded to this already but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in lewis structures depending on \\ufeffthe concept or idea that we're working with we're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes \\ufeffthe so-called formal electron county which is used to deal with formal charge and \\ufeffthe so-called total electron county which is used to assess \\ufeffthe octet rules he formal electron count is defined as \\ufeffthe formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing and by equal sharing we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms let's say a and of and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count \\ufeffthe electrons this way to in this hypothetical molecules a has one electron a has one electron so we don't double county to determine \\ufeffthe total electron count around an atom we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice so we take of and we imagine a has a pair of electrons and a has a pair of electrons now it seems like electrons have come out of thin air but for \\ufeffthe purposes of \\ufeffthe octet rules it's okay to double count electrons like this to as an example we can look at \\ufeffthe formal electron count in \\ufeffthe ammonium ion to calculate formal charge be think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons one each from its four bonds to \\ufeffthe hydrogen atoms and \\ufeffthe hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each to what we do to generate \\ufeffthe formal electron count is we split those bonds in half giving one electron to each of \\ufeffthe atoms involved and then we compare \\ufeffthe electron count of each atom to \\ufeffthe valence electron count of \\ufeffthe neutral atom of you examine \\ufeffthe periodic table you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons it's in group 15, and here \\ufeffthe nitrogen has four and so its formal charge here is plus one because it has one fewer electron in this structure than \\ufeffthe neutral atom does each of \\ufeffthe hydrogen has one valence electron and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron and so \\ufeffthe charges on \\ufeffthe hydrogen are zero and we typically don't represent this using anything special be just leave a charge off and so \\ufeffthe molecule as a whole would be drawn with \\ufeffthe formal charge near \\ufeffthe nitrogen atom something like this he total electron count is used to assess \\ufeffthe octet rules in other words it's used to evaluate whether \\ufeffthe octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure to in applying this analysis to ammonium we're actually going to give two electrons to \\ufeffthe central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at \\ufeffthe number of electrons around \\ufeffthe nitrogen to determine \\ufeffthe so-called total electron county and we're going to do \\ufeffthe same thing with \\ufeffthe hydrogen giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for \\ufeffthe purposes of total electron county to if we focus on \\ufeffthe nitrogen what we find now is that \\ufeffthe total electron count is eight and each of \\ufeffthe hydrogen has a total electron count of two and so while \\ufeffthe nitrogen is obeying \\ufeffthe octet rules \\ufeffthe hydrogen are actually exceptions to \\ufeffthe octet rules and we'll talk more about \\ufeffthe octet rule and its exceptions here in a second he octet rule says that \\ufeffthe total electron county as we defined it on \\ufeffthe last slide tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures there are a few important exceptions to \\ufeffthe octet rules and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons one of which i'm going to touch on on this slide to \\ufeffthe first is hydrogen and we've seen this already hydrogen tends to form only one bond in fact in all of \\ufeffthe structures we'll see in this course hydrogen forms one and only one bond and so its total electron count from \\ufeffthe perspective of \\ufeffthe TEc, as we defined it on \\ufeffthe last slide is only two this is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row elements it only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell neutral group of atoms are another famous case of exception to \\ufeffthe octet rules and these have six total electrons according to our convention to \\ufeffthe classic examples are for example boron and aluminium Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight sometimes not always to sulfur, for example and sulphuric acid is a nice example of this of we decompose \\ufeffthe sulphuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron county what we find is that \\ufeffthe suffer has two four six eight ten twelve electrons around it count \\ufeffthe total number of bonds here new two three four five six times two is a total electron count of twelve and that is a crazy violation of \\ufeffthe octet rules but for third-row elements in below this is okay he last example i'll mention is carbonation and carbines important intermediates in organic chemistry these are actually analogous to \\ufeffthe group of elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lessons but these have six electrons around a carbon atom either with positive charge and this is isoelectronic to \\ufeffthe group of borates and aluminium compounds and \\ufeffthe carbine is a carbon with four formal electrons four electrons in terms of valence electron county but only two bonds in important thing to note about these species \\ufeffthe atoms with six total electrons such as \\ufeffthe carbonation carbine and \\ufeffthe group of atoms is that these are often reactive and they're often reactive in \\ufeffthe sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto \\ufeffthe atom with only six total electrons on it so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms that reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in \\ufeffthe semester\",\n          \"in i'm professor Akshar at glendale community college this is physics 101, lecture of in this lecture we'll discuss units and dimensions these topics are covered in chapter a of our textbook by norway and Jouette. physics is ultimately an experimental science and as such we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature to perform those measurements we need standards of measurement or units for our measurements he three quantities that we will want to measure most often at least in this class are length time and mass to measure these three quantities we will use \\ufeffthe international system of units which is also known as \\ufeffthe of system he abbreviation of refers to \\ufeffthe french designation Syst\\u00e8me international using \\ufeffthe of system of units we'll use \\ufeffthe meter to measure length we'll use \\ufeffthe second to measure time and \\ufeffthe kilogram to measure mass he meter and \\ufeffthe kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you hopefully all of you are familiar with \\ufeffthe second but by \\ufeffthe end of this semester you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is he experimental work that we'll do in \\ufeffthe laboratory section of this class should help you with that in our study of mechanics in this class we will encounter other units in addition to \\ufeffthe meter \\ufeffthe second and \\ufeffthe kilograms however any other unit that we encounter at least in this class can be represented or expressed in terms of \\ufeffthe three base units \\ufeffthe meter \\ufeffthe second and \\ufeffthe kilograms for example later in \\ufeffthe semester when we study forces we'll find that \\ufeffthe of unit for force is \\ufeffthe newton and \\ufeffthe newton can be expressed in terms of meters seconds and kilograms as shown here to although \\ufeffthe newton seems like a new unit it really is just a combination of \\ufeffthe kilogram times \\ufeffthe meter divided by second squared a little bit later we'll talk about energy in this class and we'll find that \\ufeffthe of unit for energy is \\ufeffthe joules and \\ufeffthe joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared shortly after that we'll talk about power and we'll learn that \\ufeffthe of unit of power is \\ufeffthe watt and \\ufeffthe watt is simply \\ufeffthe kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed it this point it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force energy and power are he important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units now for \\ufeffthe sake of completeness a should mention that there are other base units in physics it turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units in this class we're primarily interested in \\ufeffthe meter which measures length or distance \\ufeffthe second which measures time or duration we're interested in \\ufeffthe kilograms which measures mass but if you go on in physics and engineering you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature he of base unit for measuring temperature is \\ufeffthe melvin of you take a course on electricity magnetism or circuits you will want to measure \\ufeffthe electric current and that is measured in amperes of you're ever taken a course on chemistry you have probably encountered \\ufeffthe mole which measures \\ufeffthe amount of substance of you want to measure luminous intensity one would use \\ufeffthe candela as \\ufeffthe of base unit we're really only going to use \\ufeffthe first three but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here be will need to convert between of and non-SI units primarily we're interested in of units that's our preferred system of measurement but in different applications you will inevitably encounter non-SI units and it's important to know how to go back and forth between \\ufeffthe of and \\ufeffthe non-SI units this table here shows a variety of of units on \\ufeffthe left and non-SI units on \\ufeffthe rights home of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized you should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimetres in fact \\ufeffthe prefix cent basically means one one hundredth to when we talk about a centimetres we're talking about one hundredth of a meter therefore there are a hundred centimetres to a meter one meter is equal to 3.281 feet one meter is also equal to 39.37 inches a thousand meters is referred to as a kilometres he prefix kilo means a thousands to a kilometre or a kilometre is a thousand meters a mile is approximately 1609 meters a minute is of seconds in hour is of minutes and each minute is of seconds to of times of is 3600 seconds to an hours one kilogram is a thousand grams a kilogram is also approximately of ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds you don't need to memorize all of these but some of them \\ufeffthe ones that are in blue \\ufeffthe ones that i've indicated here in this third or last column are \\ufeffthe ones that you should memorize these are common enough that you will encounter them frequently and you should know what these conversion factors are off \\ufeffthe top of your head he other conversion factors \\ufeffthe ones that are in black font are not so important to memorize it's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are in an exam a would probably give you \\ufeffthe conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it whenever you report \\ufeffthe result of a measurement you should report \\ufeffthe units that you used for that measurement along with \\ufeffthe number that way \\ufeffthe person that is reading your report knows how to interpret \\ufeffthe results of your measurement units are important in their own rights but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's \\ufeffthe right formula for a particular quantity for example later in \\ufeffthe semester we will encounter \\ufeffthe centripetal force it this point it may not be obvious what \\ufeffthe centripetal force is that's not so important we'll discuss it at length and i'll give you \\ufeffthe right formula for it it some point you might forget exactly what \\ufeffthe formula for centripetal force is by \\ufeffthe end of this semester you will have encountered hundreds of formulas in \\ufeffthe final exam you might forget whether \\ufeffthe centripetal force is my divided by a or my squared over re in this context a stands for mass a stands for velocity or speed and a is simply distance again we'll talk about all this in much more detail later but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether \\ufeffthe right formula is my over a or my squared over re it turns out if you're paying attention to \\ufeffthe units you can actually figure out which one of these two \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe left or \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe rights is \\ufeffthe correct formula of you have an equation and it's a valid equation then numerically \\ufeffthe left side must equal to \\ufeffthe right side but you want \\ufeffthe units to also match in other words you want \\ufeffthe units of measurement for whatever appears on \\ufeffthe left side of \\ufeffthe equation to match \\ufeffthe units for whatever appears on \\ufeffthe right side of \\ufeffthe equation for both of these equations \\ufeffthe left side represents force as we'll see later \\ufeffthe of unit for force is \\ufeffthe newton and a newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared i've used \\ufeffthe square bracket here he square bracket indicates \\ufeffthe units of to when a put square brackets around \\ufeffthe quantity i'm not really referring to \\ufeffthe value of that quantity instead i'm referring to \\ufeffthe unit for that quantity now let's look at this formula here on \\ufeffthe left he claim is that force is equal to my over re that are \\ufeffthe of units of my over re well if a is mass then it's measured in kilograms a is speed so it's measured in meters per second and a is a distance and that's measured in meters you can cancel \\ufeffthe meter that you see in \\ufeffthe denominator here with \\ufeffthe one that you see in \\ufeffthe numerator and this reduces to simply kilograms per second you can already see that this is not a good match that we have for force is this quantity here a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared and what we have for my over a is this unit this set of units obviously does not match this set of units so this is an indication that this formula is wrong in \\ufeffthe other hand our other formula says force is equal to my squared over re he square brackets again indicate \\ufeffthe units of my squared over re a is kilograms a is speed we're going to measure that in meters per second but it's speed squared so it's going to be meter squared per second squared and a is distance so that's going to be measured in meters you can see that this a here cancels one copy of \\ufeffthe a in \\ufeffthe denominator so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared and these units match exactly \\ufeffthe units for force or a newton basically of i'm trying to decide between these two formulas a can now tell you that \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe left must be incorrect and \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe right must be correct this is not a proof that \\ufeffthe formula is correct however if you know one of these formulas then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is \\ufeffthe correct one and which one is \\ufeffthe incorrect one is a mentioned earlier we have to know how to convert between i and non-Si units sometimes these conversions can get complicated so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions he method that we want to use in this class is known as \\ufeffthe factor-label methods i'll demonstrate \\ufeffthe factor-label method using an example problem he peregrine falcon considered \\ufeffthe fastest animal on earth has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hours that is \\ufeffthe speed in i units to here we've specified \\ufeffthe units but \\ufeffthe units are not \\ufeffthe same as \\ufeffthe units on \\ufeffthe left we've specified \\ufeffthe units for speed as miles per hours files and hours are not i units of we want to convert to i units we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds to we'll need two conversion factors for this process looking through your textbook or perhaps \\ufeffthe internet you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hours you should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters and you should know off \\ufeffthe top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds you should also know \\ufeffthe following fact from algebra this is simply a mathematical fact that if a is equal to of then a over a is equal to of it doesn't matter what a and a are if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other as shown here you can divide both sides of this equation by a and show that a divided by a is equal to of why is this fact important to us here well it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds then \\ufeffthe ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to of to if a quantity on \\ufeffthe left is equal to a quantity on \\ufeffthe rights a can divide both sides by let's say one hours and what i'll get is of this is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply \\ufeffthe speed of this falcon by of and multiplying by of of course does not change \\ufeffthe quantity so it's a mathematically permissible process more precisely this is what a means of you want to convert something using \\ufeffthe factor-label methods you write \\ufeffthe quantity first and make sure you write \\ufeffthe units down as well miles per hours then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert a want to do two conversions miles and hours so i'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here a know that 1,609 meters is equal to a miles so when a write it as a ratio i'm really just writing of a also know that a hour is equal to 3,600 seconds so when a divide a hour by 3,600 seconds i'm getting of which means basically i'm multiplying \\ufeffthe number 242 by of and then by a again now notice how i've written these ratios out i've chosen to write \\ufeffthe mile in \\ufeffthe denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this miles i've also written \\ufeffthe 3,600 seconds in \\ufeffthe denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have \\ufeffthe hours cancel out to if you look at this products you'll see that miles here cancels miles here and hours here cancels hours here and what we're left with is meters and seconds which is exactly \\ufeffthe same as \\ufeffthe number 242. to a can put everything into my calculator 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second that's \\ufeffthe speed of \\ufeffthe falcon in of units here's another example for you to consider be have a cylinder he cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and \\ufeffthe base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet he base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of a feet calculate \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder in cubic feet notice these quantities these dimensions here are given to you in feet so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of \\ufeffthe problem be do need to know what \\ufeffthe formula for \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder is hopefully you remember that to calculate \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder you must calculate \\ufeffthe base or \\ufeffthe top of \\ufeffthe cylinder which is simply i a squared and then you multiply that by \\ufeffthe height of \\ufeffthe cylinder to now a can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by a and don't forget pic when a put all this into my calculator a find that \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet it should make sense that \\ufeffthe volume is cubic feet because after all i've taken \\ufeffthe radius which was measured in feet and i've squared it so that's feet squared and then i've multiplied it by \\ufeffthe height so that's a third copy of \\ufeffthe same unit so a end up with cubic feet here now let us convert this volume to of units that we want to do is convert feet to meters looking at your books you will find that a meter is approximately a feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet to now what a can do is a can go back and convert \\ufeffthe radius to meters a can also convert \\ufeffthe height to meters and then a can take those converted numbers plug them into this formula use \\ufeffthe formula one more time and calculate \\ufeffthe volume in cubic meters however there is another way of doing it rather than using this formula one more time a can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters of i'm going to do \\ufeffthe foot to meter conversion a need to remember that this is feet cubed so a need three conversion factors to here i've written a meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and i've done it three times and by doing it that way i've made sure that cubic feet here gets cancelled by feet feet and feet here and then what i'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly \\ufeffthe of unit for volume now a can put all this into my calculator a can simply divide it by a divided by a or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and \\ufeffthe final answer is 3.336 cubic meters and that is \\ufeffthe end of this lecture thank you for your attention\",\n          \"to here is something funny you might say OK, what is simpler a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear and \\ufeffthe answer of course a linear theory is much simpler maxwells equations are linear einsteins theory of relativity is very nonlinear very complicated now about classical mechanics is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear that do we think can't hear anyone linear OK. you may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple but it's not this actually is very nonlinear newton could solve \\ufeffthe two-body problem but he couldn't solve \\ufeffthe three-body problem already with three bodies you cannot superposed solutions that you get with two bodies it's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics get me show you of you have motion in one dimensions in 1D, you have \\ufeffthe equation of motion motion in one dimension under a potential a of a that is time independent a particle moving in one dimensions a with under \\ufeffthe influence of a potential a of of he second \\ufeffthe dynamical variable is a of to \\ufeffthe dynamical variable and \\ufeffthe equation of motion is so let me explain this this is force equal mass times acceleration this is mass this is acceleration \\ufeffthe second derivative of \\ufeffthe position and a force is minus \\ufeffthe derivative of \\ufeffthe potential evaluated at \\ufeffthe position derivatives of potentials if you think of a potential \\ufeffthe derivative of \\ufeffthe potential is here positive and you know you have a mass here it tends to go to \\ufeffthe left to \\ufeffthe force is on \\ufeffthe left to it's minus to a prime is \\ufeffthe derivative of a with respect to its argument and \\ufeffthe problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operations if you take two derivatives of a sum of things you take two derivatives of \\ufeffthe first plus two derivatives of \\ufeffthe second but yes this side is linear but this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary and \\ufeffthe derivatives so suppose \\ufeffthe potential is cubic in of a of a goes like a cubed when \\ufeffthe derivative of a goes like a squared and a squared is not a linear function to this newtons equation is not a linear equation and therefore it's complicated to solve very complicated to solve to finally we get to our case quantum mechanics to in quantum mechanics what do we have in quantum mechanics it's linear first you need an equation and whose equation is it Schrodinger's equation 1925. be writes an equation for \\ufeffthe dynamical variable and \\ufeffthe dynamical variable is something called \\ufeffthe wave function this wave function can depend on to depends on time and it may depend on other things as well and it describes \\ufeffthe dynamics of \\ufeffthe quantum system as it evolves in time there is \\ufeffthe wave function and you have an equation for this wave function and what is \\ufeffthe equation for this wave function it's a universal equation i a bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to a hat psi where a hat is called \\ufeffthe hamiltonian and it's a linear operator that's why a had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is this is \\ufeffthe general structure of \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation it's a time derivative and a linear operator to if you wish to write \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation as an a psi equals of then a psi would be defined as i a bar a it of psi minus a hat psi when this is \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation this equation here schrodinger equation and as you can see it's a linear equation you can check it check that a is a linear operator therefore it is naturally linear you can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operations of you have \\ufeffthe a it of a number times a function \\ufeffthe number goes out you differentiate \\ufeffthe function a it of \\ufeffthe sum of two functions you differentiate \\ufeffthe first you differentiate it to this is linear and he we said is linear to a is going to be linear and \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation and therefore you're going to have \\ufeffthe great advantage that any time you find solutions you can scale them you can add them you can put them together combine them in superpositions and find new solutions to in that sense it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics and in fact you will see throughout this semester how \\ufeffthe mathematics and \\ufeffthe things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics are more elegant more beautiful more coherent it's simpler and very nice i is \\ufeffthe square root of minus of is \\ufeffthe imaginary unit and that's what we're going to talk next on \\ufeffthe necessity of complex numbers a bar yes it's a number it shows up in quantum mechanics early on it's called Planck's constant and it began when planck tried to fit \\ufeffthe blackbody spectrum and he found \\ufeffthe need to put a constant in there and then later einstein figured out that it was very relevant to yes it's a number for any physical system that you have you will have a wave function and you will have a hamiltonian and \\ufeffthe hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover to if you have a particle moving on a line \\ufeffthe wave function will depend on time and on of of you have a particle moving in three dimensions it will depend on a vector it may depend on other things as well or it may be like one particle has several wave functions and that happens when you have a particle with spin to in general always time sometimes position there may be cases where it doesn't depend on position you think of an electron at some point in space and it's fixed you lock it there and you want to understand \\ufeffthe physics of that electron locked into place and then position is not relevant to what it does with its spin is relevant and then you may need more than one wave function that is one describing \\ufeffthe spin up and one describing \\ufeffthe spin down to it was funny that schrodinger wrote this equation and when asked so what is \\ufeffthe wave function he said a don't know to physical interpretation for \\ufeffthe wave function was obvious for \\ufeffthe people that invented quantum mechanics it took a few months until tax porn said it has to do with probabilities and that's what we're going to get next to our next point is \\ufeffthe necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics\"\n        ],\n

So let's return to the idea of drawing Lewis structures. The first thing I want to say about this is that this is really a process, not an algorithm. If you got the idea from introductory chemistry that drawing Lewis structures based on a formula is, for example, a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at the same Lewis structure, hate to break it to you, but you got the wrong idea. This is more of a process. It's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a Lewis structure. Where the error generally tends to lie is in the first step, which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton. The sigma skeleton shows how the atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds. The sigma skeleton consumes or uses up the sigma electrons in the molecule. The question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good question, and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this. In general, we find less electronegative atoms near the center of Lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds. They have a higher what's called valence, and so we find near the center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence. We can use the way the formula is written as a guide, and you'll start recognizing patterns here. Patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogens bound to a carbon, NO2 indicating two oxygens bound to nitrogen, and even patterns in the way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group. Once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down, we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to the structure until we've satisfied the octet rule and all the valence electrons are used up. So here, for example, we might add a lone pair to this atom, a multiple bond here, maybe a triple bond here, something like this, until we've satisfied the octet rule on every atom and all the valence electrons are used up. And what this means is that the total valence electron count for all of the atoms in the structure is equal to the sum of the sigma electrons, the electrons in the sigma skeleton, and the pi and non-bonding electrons that we find in lone pairs and pi bonds. We then add formal charges based on the formal electron count of each atom relative to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. We'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video. And then finally, we check that the total number of electrons really is equal to the sum of the valence electron counts of all the atoms, and, and this is an important piece that's not on the slide, we also need to consider the overall charge of the molecule in counting up the number of valence electrons. If the charge is negative, we need to add electrons, and if it's positive, we need to take electrons away. So considering the overall charge is very important here as well. This last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in the reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one, if needed, to generate a new sigma skeleton. So really you should think about drawing Lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to the end, you want to evaluate, is the octet rule satisfied, does the structure make sense, and is the structure reasonable? And quite often, you'll need to do this evaluation on Lewis structures that you're looking at or that you've drawn yourself based on given Lewis structures, not for the molecule as a whole, but for specific regions of interest within a molecule, and so this evaluation or this check is really important, particularly for shorthand, which we'll move to in the second half of this video. We alluded to this already, but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in Lewis structures depending on the concept or idea that we're working with. We're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes, the so-called formal electron count, which is used to deal with formal charge, and the so-called total electron count, which is used to assess the octet rule. The formal electron count is defined as the formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing, and by equal sharing, we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms, let's say A and B, and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count the electrons this way. So in this hypothetical molecule, A has one electron, B has one electron, so we don't double count. To determine the total electron count around an atom, we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice, so we take AB and we imagine A has a pair of electrons and B has a pair of electrons. Now, it seems like electrons have come out of thin air, but for the purposes of the octet rule, it's okay to double count electrons like this. So as an example, we can look at the formal electron count in the ammonium ion to calculate formal charge. We think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons, one each from its four bonds to the hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each. So what we do to generate the formal electron count is we split those bonds in half, giving one electron to each of the atoms involved, and then we compare the electron count of each atom to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. If you examine the periodic table, you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons. It's in group 15, and here the nitrogen has four, and so its formal charge here is plus one, because it has one fewer electron in this structure than the neutral atom does. Each of the hydrogens has one valence electron, and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron, and so the charges on the hydrogens are zero, and we typically don't represent this using anything special. We just leave a charge off, and so the molecule as a whole would be drawn with the formal charge near the nitrogen atom, something like this. The total electron count is used to assess the octet rule. In other words, it's used to evaluate whether the octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure. So in applying this analysis to ammonium, we're actually going to give two electrons to the central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at the number of electrons around the nitrogen to determine the so-called total electron count, and we're going to do the same thing with the hydrogens, giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for the purposes of total electron count. So if we focus on the nitrogen, what we find now is that the total electron count is eight, and each of the hydrogens has a total electron count of two, and so while the nitrogen is obeying the octet rule, the hydrogens are actually exceptions to the octet rule, and we'll talk more about the octet rule and its exceptions here in a second. The octet rule says that the total electron count, as we defined it on the last slide, tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures. There are a few important exceptions to the octet rule, and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight. Recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons, one of which I'm going to touch on on this slide. So the first is hydrogen, and we've seen this already. Hydrogen tends to form only one bond. In fact, in all of the structures we'll see in this course, hydrogen forms one and only one bond, and so its total electron count from the perspective of the TEc, as we defined it on the last slide, is only two. This is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row element. It only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell. Neutral group 13 atoms are another famous case of exception to the octet rule, and these have six total electrons according to our convention. So the classic examples are, for example, boron and aluminum. Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight, sometimes, not always. So sulfur, for example, and sulfuric acid is a nice example of this. If we decompose the sulfuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron count, what we find is that the sulfur has two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve electrons around it. Count the total number of bonds here. One, two, three, four, five, six times two is a total electron count of twelve, and that is a crazy violation of the octet rule, but for third-row elements in below, this is okay. The last example I'll mention is carbocation and carbenes, important intermediates in organic chemistry. These are actually analogous to the group 13 elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lesson, but these have six electrons around a carbon atom, either with positive charge, and this is isoelectronic to the group 13 boranes and aluminum compounds, and the carbene is a carbon with four formal electrons, four electrons in terms of valence electron count, but only two bonds. An important thing to note about these species, the atoms with six total electrons, such as the carbocation, carbene, and the group 13 atoms, is that these are often reactive, and they're often reactive in the sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto the atom with only six total electrons on it, so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms. That reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in the semester.\",\n          \" Hi, I'm Professor Akshar at Glendale Community College. This is Physics 101, Lecture 1. In this lecture, we'll discuss units and dimensions. These topics are covered in Chapter 1 of our textbook by Surway and Jouette. Physics is ultimately an experimental science, and as such, we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature. To perform those measurements, we need standards of measurement, or units for our measurements. The three quantities that we will want to measure most often, at least in this class, are length, time, and mass. To measure these three quantities, we will use the International System of Units, which is also known as the SI system. The abbreviation SI refers to the French designation Syst\\u00e8me International. Using the SI system of units, we'll use the meter to measure length, we'll use the second to measure time, and the kilogram to measure mass. The meter and the kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you, hopefully all of you are familiar with the second, but by the end of this semester, you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is. The experimental work that we'll do in the laboratory section of this class should help you with that. In our study of mechanics in this class, we will encounter other units in addition to the meter, the second, and the kilogram. However, any other unit that we encounter, at least in this class, can be represented or expressed in terms of the three base units, the meter, the second, and the kilogram. For example, later in the semester when we study forces, we'll find that the SI unit for force is the newton, and the newton can be expressed in terms of meters, seconds, and kilograms as shown here. So although the newton seems like a new unit, it really is just a combination of the kilogram times the meter divided by second squared. A little bit later, we'll talk about energy in this class, and we'll find that the SI unit for energy is the joule, and the joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared. Shortly after that, we'll talk about power, and we'll learn that the SI unit of power is the watt, and the watt is simply the kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed. At this point, it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from, and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force, energy, and power are. The important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well, because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units. Now, for the sake of completeness, I should mention that there are other base units in physics. It turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units. In this class, we're primarily interested in the meter, which measures length or distance, the second, which measures time or duration. We're interested in the kilogram, which measures mass. But if you go on in physics and engineering, you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature. The SI base unit for measuring temperature is the Kelvin. If you take a course on electricity, magnetism, or circuits, you will want to measure the electric current, and that is measured in amperes. If you've ever taken a course on chemistry, you have probably encountered the mole, which measures the amount of substance. If you want to measure luminous intensity, one would use the candela as the SI base unit. We're really only going to use the first three, but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here. We will need to convert between SI and non-SI units. Primarily, we're interested in SI units. That's our preferred system of measurement. But in different applications, you will inevitably encounter non-SI units, and it's important to know how to go back and forth between the SI and the non-SI units. This table here shows a variety of SI units on the left and non-SI units on the right. Some of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized. You should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimeters. In fact, the prefix centi basically means one one hundredth. So when we talk about a centimeter, we're talking about one hundredth of a meter. Therefore, there are a hundred centimeters to a meter. One meter is equal to 3.281 feet. One meter is also equal to 39.37 inches. A thousand meters is referred to as a kilometer. The prefix kilo means a thousand. So a kilometer or a kilometer is a thousand meters. A mile is approximately 1609 meters. A minute is 60 seconds. An hour is 60 minutes, and each minute is 60 seconds. So 60 times 60 is 3600 seconds to an hour. One kilogram is a thousand grams. A kilogram is also approximately 35 ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds. You don't need to memorize all of these, but some of them, the ones that are in blue, the ones that I've indicated here in this third or last column, are the ones that you should memorize. These are common enough that you will encounter them frequently, and you should know what these conversion factors are off the top of your head. The other conversion factors, the ones that are in black font, are not so important to memorize. It's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are. On an exam, I would probably give you the conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it. Whenever you report the result of a measurement, you should report the units that you used for that measurement, along with the number. That way, the person that is reading your report knows how to interpret the results of your measurement. Units are important in their own right, but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units. Keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations. Keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations. Keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's the right formula for a particular quantity. For example, later in the semester, we will encounter the centripetal force. At this point, it may not be obvious what the centripetal force is. That's not so important. We'll discuss it at length and I'll give you the right formula for it. At some point, you might forget exactly what the formula for centripetal force is. By the end of this semester, you will have encountered hundreds of formulas. On the final exam, you might forget whether the centripetal force is mv divided by r or mv squared over r. In this context, m stands for mass, v stands for velocity or speed, and r is simply distance. Again, we'll talk about all this in much more detail later, but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether the right formula is mv over r or mv squared over r. It turns out if you're paying attention to the units, you can actually figure out which one of these two, the one on the left or the one on the right, is the correct formula. If you have an equation and it's a valid equation, then numerically the left side must equal to the right side, but you want the units to also match. In other words, you want the units of measurement for whatever appears on the left side of the equation to match the units for whatever appears on the right side of the equation. For both of these equations, the left side represents force, as we'll see later, the SI unit for force is the Newton, and a Newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared. I've used the square bracket here. The square bracket indicates the units of. So when I put square brackets around the quantity, I'm not really referring to the value of that quantity. Instead, I'm referring to the unit for that quantity. Now let's look at this formula here on the left. The claim is that force is equal to mv over r. What are the SI units of mv over r? Well, if m is mass, then it's measured in kilograms. V is speed, so it's measured in meters per second, and r is a distance, and that's measured in meters. You can cancel the meter that you see in the denominator here with the one that you see in the numerator, and this reduces to simply kilograms per second. You can already see that this is not a good match. What we have for force is this quantity here, a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared, and what we have for mv over r is this unit. This set of units obviously does not match this set of units, so this is an indication that this formula is wrong. On the other hand, our other formula says force is equal to mv squared over r. The square brackets again indicate the units of mv squared over r. m is kilograms, v is speed. We're going to measure that in meters per second, but it's speed squared, so it's going to be meter squared per second squared, and r is distance, so that's going to be measured in meters. You can see that this m here cancels one copy of the m in the denominator, so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared, and these units match exactly the units for force, or a newton basically. If I'm trying to decide between these two formulas, I can now tell you that the one on the left must be incorrect and the one on the right must be correct. This is not a proof that the formula is correct. However, if you know one of these formulas, then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is the correct one and which one is the incorrect one. As I mentioned earlier, we have to know how to convert between Si and non-Si units. Sometimes these conversions can get complicated, so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions. The method that we want to use in this class is known as the factor-label method. I'll demonstrate the factor-label method using an example problem. The peregrine falcon, considered the fastest animal on earth, has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hour. What is the speed in Si units? So here we've specified the units, but the units are not the same as the units on the left. We've specified the units for speed as miles per hour. Miles and hours are not Si units. If we want to convert to Si units, we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds. So we'll need two conversion factors for this process. Looking through your textbook or perhaps the internet, you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hour. You should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters. And you should know off the top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds. You should also know the following fact from algebra. This is simply a mathematical fact that if A is equal to B, then A over B is equal to 1. It doesn't matter what A and B are, if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other, as shown here, you can divide both sides of this equation by B and show that A divided by B is equal to 1. Why is this fact important to us here? Well, it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, then the ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to 1. So if a quantity on the left is equal to a quantity on the right, I can divide both sides by, let's say, one hour, and what I'll get is 1. This is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply the speed of this falcon by 1. And multiplying by 1, of course, does not change the quantity, so it's a mathematically permissible process. More precisely, this is what I mean. If you want to convert something using the factor-label method, you write the quantity first, and make sure you write the units down as well, miles per hour, then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert. I want to do two conversions, miles and hours, so I'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here. I know that 1,609 meters is equal to 1 miles, so when I write it as a ratio, I'm really just writing 1. I also know that 1 hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, so when I divide 1 hour by 3,600 seconds, I'm getting 1. Which means basically I'm multiplying the number 242 by 1, and then by 1 again. Now notice how I've written these ratios out. I've chosen to write the mile in the denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this mile. I've also written the 3,600 seconds in the denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have the hours cancel out. So if you look at this product, you'll see that miles here cancels miles here, and hours here cancels hours here, and what we're left with is meters and seconds, which is exactly the same as the number 242. So I can put everything into my calculator. 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second. That's the speed of the Falcon in SI units. Here's another example for you to consider. We have a cylinder. The cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and the base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet. The base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of 6 feet. Calculate the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet. Notice these quantities, these dimensions here are given to you in feet, so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of the problem. We do need to know what the formula for the volume of the cylinder is. Hopefully you remember that. To calculate the volume of the cylinder, you must calculate the base or the top of the cylinder, which is simply pi r squared, and then you multiply that by the height of the cylinder. So now I can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by 6 and don't forget pi. When I put all this into my calculator, I find that the volume of the cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet. It should make sense that the volume is cubic feet because after all I've taken the radius, which was measured in feet and I've squared it, so that's feet squared and then I've multiplied it by the height, so that's a third copy of the same unit, so I end up with cubic feet here. Now let us convert this volume to SI units. What we want to do is convert feet to meters. Looking at your book, you will find that 1 meter is approximately 3 feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet. So now what I can do is I can go back and convert the radius to meters. I can also convert the height to meters and then I can take those converted numbers, plug them into this formula, use the formula one more time and calculate the volume in cubic meters. However, there is another way of doing it. Rather than using this formula one more time, I can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters. If I'm going to do the foot to meter conversion, I need to remember that this is feet cubed so I need three conversion factors. So here I've written 1 meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and I've done it three times and by doing it that way I've made sure that cubic feet here gets canceled by feet, feet and feet here and then what I'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly the SI unit for volume. Now I can put all this into my calculator, I can simply divide it by 3 divided by 3 or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and the final answer is 3.336 cubic meters. And that is the end of this lecture. Thank you for your attention.\",\n          \" So here is something funny. You might say, OK, what is simpler, a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear? And the answer, of course, a linear theory is much simpler. Maxwell's equations are linear. Einstein's theory of relativity is very nonlinear, very complicated. How about classical mechanics? Is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear? What do we think? Can't hear anyone. Linear, OK. You may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple, but it's not. This actually is very nonlinear. Newton could solve the two-body problem, but he couldn't solve the three-body problem. Already with three bodies, you cannot superpose solutions that you get with two bodies. It's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics. Let me show you. If you have motion in one dimension, in 1D, you have the equation of motion, motion in one dimension under a potential v of x that is time independent, a particle moving in one dimension, x with under the influence of a potential v of x. The second, the dynamical variable is x of t, the dynamical variable. And the equation of motion is, so let me explain this. This is force equal mass times acceleration. This is mass. This is acceleration, the second derivative of the position. And v force is minus the derivative of the potential evaluated at the position. Derivatives of potentials, if you think of a potential, the derivative of the potential is here positive. And you know you have a mass here. It tends to go to the left. So the force is on the left. So it's minus. So v prime is the derivative of v with respect to its argument. And the problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operation, if you take two derivatives of a sum of things, you take two derivatives of the first plus two derivatives of the second. But yes, this side is linear. But this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary. And the derivative, so suppose the potential is cubic in x. v of x goes like x cubed. Then the derivative of v goes like x squared. And x squared is not a linear function. So this Newton's equation is not a linear equation. And therefore, it's complicated to solve, very complicated to solve. So finally, we get to our case, quantum mechanics. So in quantum mechanics, what do we have? In quantum mechanics, it's linear. First, you need an equation. And whose equation is it? Schrodinger's equation, 1925. He writes an equation for the dynamical variable. And the dynamical variable is something called the wave function. This wave function can depend on t, depends on time. And it may depend on other things as well. And it describes the dynamics of the quantum system as it evolves in time. There is the wave function. And you have an equation for this wave function. And what is the equation for this wave function? It's a universal equation. i h bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to h hat psi, where h hat is called the Hamiltonian. And it's a linear operator. That's why I had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is. This is the general structure of the Schrodinger equation. It's a time derivative and a linear operator. So if you wish to write the Schrodinger equation as an L psi equals 0, then L psi would be defined as i h bar d dt of psi minus h hat psi. Then this is the Schrodinger equation. This equation here, Schrodinger equation. And as you can see, it's a linear equation. You can check it. Check that L is a linear operator. Therefore, it is naturally linear. You can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operation. If you have the d dt of a number times a function, the number goes out. You differentiate the function. d dt of the sum of two functions, you differentiate the first, you differentiate it. So this is linear. And h, we said, is linear. So L is going to be linear. And the Schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation. And therefore, you're going to have the great advantage that any time you find solutions, you can scale them. You can add them. You can put them together, combine them in superpositions, and find new solutions. So in that sense, it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics. And in fact, you will see throughout this semester how the mathematics and the things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics, are more elegant, more beautiful, more coherent. It's simpler and very nice. i is the square root of minus 1, is the imaginary unit. And that's what we're going to talk next on the necessity of complex numbers. h bar, yes, it's a number. It shows up in quantum mechanics early on. It's called Planck's constant. And it began when Planck tried to fit the black-body spectrum. And he found the need to put a constant in there. And then later, Einstein figured out that it was very relevant. So yes, it's a number. For any physical system that you have, you will have a wave function. And you will have a Hamiltonian. And the Hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover. So if you have a particle moving on a line, the wave function will depend on time and on x. If you have a particle moving in three dimensions, it will depend on x vector. It may depend on other things as well. Or it may be like one particle has several wave functions. And that happens when you have a particle with spin. So in general, always time, sometimes position. There may be cases where it doesn't depend on position. You think of an electron at some point in space. And it's fixed. You lock it there. And you want to understand the physics of that electron locked into place. And then position is not relevant. So what it does with its spin is relevant. And then you may need more than one wave function. What is one describing the spin up and one describing the spin down? So it was funny that Schrodinger wrote this equation. And when asked, so what is the wave function, he said, I don't know. No physical interpretation for the wave function was obvious for the people that invented quantum mechanics. It took a few months until Max Born said it has to do with probabilities. And that's what we're going to get next. So our next point is the necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

structures now and talk about \\ufeffthe shorthand that organic chemists use to represent lewis structures containing a large number of atoms and a good deal of structural complexity to let's return to \\ufeffthe idea of drawing lewis structures he first thing a want to say about this is that this is really a process not an algorithm of you got \\ufeffthe idea from introductory chemistry that drawing lewis structures based on a formula is for example a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at \\ufeffthe same lewis structure hate to break it to you but you got \\ufeffthe wrong ideas this is more of a process it's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a lewis structure there \\ufeffthe error generally tends to lie is in \\ufeffthe first step which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton he sigma skeleton shows how \\ufeffthe atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds he sigma skeleton consumes or uses up \\ufeffthe sigma electrons in \\ufeffthe molecules he question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good questions and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this in general we find less electronegative atoms near \\ufeffthe center of lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds they have a higher what's called valence and so we find near \\ufeffthe center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence be can use \\ufeffthe way \\ufeffthe formula is written as a guide and you'll start recognizing patterns here patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogen bound to a carbon NO2 indicating two oxygen bound to nitrogen and even patterns in \\ufeffthe way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to \\ufeffthe structure until we've satisfied \\ufeffthe octet rule and all \\ufeffthe valence electrons are used up to here for example we might add a lone pair to this atom a multiple bond here maybe a triple bond here something like this until we've satisfied \\ufeffthe octet rule on every atom and all \\ufeffthe valence electrons are used up and what this means is that \\ufeffthe total valence electron count for all of \\ufeffthe atoms in \\ufeffthe structure is equal to \\ufeffthe sum of \\ufeffthe sigma electrons \\ufeffthe electrons in \\ufeffthe sigma skeleton and \\ufeffthe i and nonbinding electrons that we find in lone pairs and i bonds be then add formal charges based on \\ufeffthe formal electron count of each atom relative to \\ufeffthe valence electron count of \\ufeffthe neutral atom we'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video and then finally we check that \\ufeffthe total number of electrons really is equal to \\ufeffthe sum of \\ufeffthe valence electron counts of all \\ufeffthe atoms and and this is an important piece that's not on \\ufeffthe slide we also need to consider \\ufeffthe overall charge of \\ufeffthe molecule in counting up \\ufeffthe number of valence electrons of \\ufeffthe charge is negative we need to add electrons and if it's positive we need to take electrons away to considering \\ufeffthe overall charge is very important here as well this last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in \\ufeffthe reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one if needed to generate a new sigma skeleton to really you should think about drawing lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to \\ufeffthe end you want to evaluate is \\ufeffthe octet rule satisfied does \\ufeffthe structure make sense and is \\ufeffthe structure reasonable and quite often you'll need to do this evaluation on lewis structures that you're looking at or that you're drawn yourself based on given lewis structures not for \\ufeffthe molecule as a whole but for specific regions of interest within a molecules and so this evaluation or this check is really important particularly for shorthand which we'll move to in \\ufeffthe second half of this video be alluded to this already but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in lewis structures depending on \\ufeffthe concept or idea that we're working with we're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes \\ufeffthe so-called formal electron county which is used to deal with formal charge and \\ufeffthe so-called total electron county which is used to assess \\ufeffthe octet rules he formal electron count is defined as \\ufeffthe formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing and by equal sharing we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms let's say a and of and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count \\ufeffthe electrons this way to in this hypothetical molecules a has one electron a has one electron so we don't double county to determine \\ufeffthe total electron count around an atom we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice so we take of and we imagine a has a pair of electrons and a has a pair of electrons now it seems like electrons have come out of thin air but for \\ufeffthe purposes of \\ufeffthe octet rules it's okay to double count electrons like this to as an example we can look at \\ufeffthe formal electron count in \\ufeffthe ammonium ion to calculate formal charge be think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons one each from its four bonds to \\ufeffthe hydrogen atoms and \\ufeffthe hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each to what we do to generate \\ufeffthe formal electron count is we split those bonds in half giving one electron to each of \\ufeffthe atoms involved and then we compare \\ufeffthe electron count of each atom to \\ufeffthe valence electron count of \\ufeffthe neutral atom of you examine \\ufeffthe periodic table you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons it's in group 15, and here \\ufeffthe nitrogen has four and so its formal charge here is plus one because it has one fewer electron in this structure than \\ufeffthe neutral atom does each of \\ufeffthe hydrogen has one valence electron and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron and so \\ufeffthe charges on \\ufeffthe hydrogen are zero and we typically don't represent this using anything special be just leave a charge off and so \\ufeffthe molecule as a whole would be drawn with \\ufeffthe formal charge near \\ufeffthe nitrogen atom something like this he total electron count is used to assess \\ufeffthe octet rules in other words it's used to evaluate whether \\ufeffthe octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure to in applying this analysis to ammonium we're actually going to give two electrons to \\ufeffthe central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at \\ufeffthe number of electrons around \\ufeffthe nitrogen to determine \\ufeffthe so-called total electron county and we're going to do \\ufeffthe same thing with \\ufeffthe hydrogen giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for \\ufeffthe purposes of total electron county to if we focus on \\ufeffthe nitrogen what we find now is that \\ufeffthe total electron count is eight and each of \\ufeffthe hydrogen has a total electron count of two and so while \\ufeffthe nitrogen is obeying \\ufeffthe octet rules \\ufeffthe hydrogen are actually exceptions to \\ufeffthe octet rules and we'll talk more about \\ufeffthe octet rule and its exceptions here in a second he octet rule says that \\ufeffthe total electron county as we defined it on \\ufeffthe last slide tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures there are a few important exceptions to \\ufeffthe octet rules and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons one of which i'm going to touch on on this slide to \\ufeffthe first is hydrogen and we've seen this already hydrogen tends to form only one bond in fact in all of \\ufeffthe structures we'll see in this course hydrogen forms one and only one bond and so its total electron count from \\ufeffthe perspective of \\ufeffthe TEc, as we defined it on \\ufeffthe last slide is only two this is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row elements it only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell neutral group of atoms are another famous case of exception to \\ufeffthe octet rules and these have six total electrons according to our convention to \\ufeffthe classic examples are for example boron and aluminium Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight sometimes not always to sulfur, for example and sulphuric acid is a nice example of this of we decompose \\ufeffthe sulphuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron county what we find is that \\ufeffthe suffer has two four six eight ten twelve electrons around it count \\ufeffthe total number of bonds here new two three four five six times two is a total electron count of twelve and that is a crazy violation of \\ufeffthe octet rules but for third-row elements in below this is okay he last example i'll mention is carbonation and carbines important intermediates in organic chemistry these are actually analogous to \\ufeffthe group of elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lessons but these have six electrons around a carbon atom either with positive charge and this is isoelectronic to \\ufeffthe group of borates and aluminium compounds and \\ufeffthe carbine is a carbon with four formal electrons four electrons in terms of valence electron county but only two bonds in important thing to note about these species \\ufeffthe atoms with six total electrons such as \\ufeffthe carbonation carbine and \\ufeffthe group of atoms is that these are often reactive and they're often reactive in \\ufeffthe sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto \\ufeffthe atom with only six total electrons on it so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms that reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in \\ufeffthe semester\",\n          \"in i'm professor Akshar at glendale community college this is physics 101, lecture of in this lecture we'll discuss units and dimensions these topics are covered in chapter a of our textbook by norway and Jouette. physics is ultimately an experimental science and as such we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature to perform those measurements we need standards of measurement or units for our measurements he three quantities that we will want to measure most often at least in this class are length time and mass to measure these three quantities we will use \\ufeffthe international system of units which is also known as \\ufeffthe of system he abbreviation of refers to \\ufeffthe french designation Syst\\u00e8me international using \\ufeffthe of system of units we'll use \\ufeffthe meter to measure length we'll use \\ufeffthe second to measure time and \\ufeffthe kilogram to measure mass he meter and \\ufeffthe kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you hopefully all of you are familiar with \\ufeffthe second but by \\ufeffthe end of this semester you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is he experimental work that we'll do in \\ufeffthe laboratory section of this class should help you with that in our study of mechanics in this class we will encounter other units in addition to \\ufeffthe meter \\ufeffthe second and \\ufeffthe kilograms however any other unit that we encounter at least in this class can be represented or expressed in terms of \\ufeffthe three base units \\ufeffthe meter \\ufeffthe second and \\ufeffthe kilograms for example later in \\ufeffthe semester when we study forces we'll find that \\ufeffthe of unit for force is \\ufeffthe newton and \\ufeffthe newton can be expressed in terms of meters seconds and kilograms as shown here to although \\ufeffthe newton seems like a new unit it really is just a combination of \\ufeffthe kilogram times \\ufeffthe meter divided by second squared a little bit later we'll talk about energy in this class and we'll find that \\ufeffthe of unit for energy is \\ufeffthe joules and \\ufeffthe joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared shortly after that we'll talk about power and we'll learn that \\ufeffthe of unit of power is \\ufeffthe watt and \\ufeffthe watt is simply \\ufeffthe kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed it this point it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force energy and power are he important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units now for \\ufeffthe sake of completeness a should mention that there are other base units in physics it turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units in this class we're primarily interested in \\ufeffthe meter which measures length or distance \\ufeffthe second which measures time or duration we're interested in \\ufeffthe kilograms which measures mass but if you go on in physics and engineering you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature he of base unit for measuring temperature is \\ufeffthe melvin of you take a course on electricity magnetism or circuits you will want to measure \\ufeffthe electric current and that is measured in amperes of you're ever taken a course on chemistry you have probably encountered \\ufeffthe mole which measures \\ufeffthe amount of substance of you want to measure luminous intensity one would use \\ufeffthe candela as \\ufeffthe of base unit we're really only going to use \\ufeffthe first three but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here be will need to convert between of and non-SI units primarily we're interested in of units that's our preferred system of measurement but in different applications you will inevitably encounter non-SI units and it's important to know how to go back and forth between \\ufeffthe of and \\ufeffthe non-SI units this table here shows a variety of of units on \\ufeffthe left and non-SI units on \\ufeffthe rights home of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized you should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimetres in fact \\ufeffthe prefix cent basically means one one hundredth to when we talk about a centimetres we're talking about one hundredth of a meter therefore there are a hundred centimetres to a meter one meter is equal to 3.281 feet one meter is also equal to 39.37 inches a thousand meters is referred to as a kilometres he prefix kilo means a thousands to a kilometre or a kilometre is a thousand meters a mile is approximately 1609 meters a minute is of seconds in hour is of minutes and each minute is of seconds to of times of is 3600 seconds to an hours one kilogram is a thousand grams a kilogram is also approximately of ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds you don't need to memorize all of these but some of them \\ufeffthe ones that are in blue \\ufeffthe ones that i've indicated here in this third or last column are \\ufeffthe ones that you should memorize these are common enough that you will encounter them frequently and you should know what these conversion factors are off \\ufeffthe top of your head he other conversion factors \\ufeffthe ones that are in black font are not so important to memorize it's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are in an exam a would probably give you \\ufeffthe conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it whenever you report \\ufeffthe result of a measurement you should report \\ufeffthe units that you used for that measurement along with \\ufeffthe number that way \\ufeffthe person that is reading your report knows how to interpret \\ufeffthe results of your measurement units are important in their own rights but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's \\ufeffthe right formula for a particular quantity for example later in \\ufeffthe semester we will encounter \\ufeffthe centripetal force it this point it may not be obvious what \\ufeffthe centripetal force is that's not so important we'll discuss it at length and i'll give you \\ufeffthe right formula for it it some point you might forget exactly what \\ufeffthe formula for centripetal force is by \\ufeffthe end of this semester you will have encountered hundreds of formulas in \\ufeffthe final exam you might forget whether \\ufeffthe centripetal force is my divided by a or my squared over re in this context a stands for mass a stands for velocity or speed and a is simply distance again we'll talk about all this in much more detail later but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether \\ufeffthe right formula is my over a or my squared over re it turns out if you're paying attention to \\ufeffthe units you can actually figure out which one of these two \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe left or \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe rights is \\ufeffthe correct formula of you have an equation and it's a valid equation then numerically \\ufeffthe left side must equal to \\ufeffthe right side but you want \\ufeffthe units to also match in other words you want \\ufeffthe units of measurement for whatever appears on \\ufeffthe left side of \\ufeffthe equation to match \\ufeffthe units for whatever appears on \\ufeffthe right side of \\ufeffthe equation for both of these equations \\ufeffthe left side represents force as we'll see later \\ufeffthe of unit for force is \\ufeffthe newton and a newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared i've used \\ufeffthe square bracket here he square bracket indicates \\ufeffthe units of to when a put square brackets around \\ufeffthe quantity i'm not really referring to \\ufeffthe value of that quantity instead i'm referring to \\ufeffthe unit for that quantity now let's look at this formula here on \\ufeffthe left he claim is that force is equal to my over re that are \\ufeffthe of units of my over re well if a is mass then it's measured in kilograms a is speed so it's measured in meters per second and a is a distance and that's measured in meters you can cancel \\ufeffthe meter that you see in \\ufeffthe denominator here with \\ufeffthe one that you see in \\ufeffthe numerator and this reduces to simply kilograms per second you can already see that this is not a good match that we have for force is this quantity here a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared and what we have for my over a is this unit this set of units obviously does not match this set of units so this is an indication that this formula is wrong in \\ufeffthe other hand our other formula says force is equal to my squared over re he square brackets again indicate \\ufeffthe units of my squared over re a is kilograms a is speed we're going to measure that in meters per second but it's speed squared so it's going to be meter squared per second squared and a is distance so that's going to be measured in meters you can see that this a here cancels one copy of \\ufeffthe a in \\ufeffthe denominator so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared and these units match exactly \\ufeffthe units for force or a newton basically of i'm trying to decide between these two formulas a can now tell you that \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe left must be incorrect and \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe right must be correct this is not a proof that \\ufeffthe formula is correct however if you know one of these formulas then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is \\ufeffthe correct one and which one is \\ufeffthe incorrect one is a mentioned earlier we have to know how to convert between i and non-Si units sometimes these conversions can get complicated so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions he method that we want to use in this class is known as \\ufeffthe factor-label methods i'll demonstrate \\ufeffthe factor-label method using an example problem he peregrine falcon considered \\ufeffthe fastest animal on earth has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hours that is \\ufeffthe speed in i units to here we've specified \\ufeffthe units but \\ufeffthe units are not \\ufeffthe same as \\ufeffthe units on \\ufeffthe left we've specified \\ufeffthe units for speed as miles per hours files and hours are not i units of we want to convert to i units we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds to we'll need two conversion factors for this process looking through your textbook or perhaps \\ufeffthe internet you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hours you should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters and you should know off \\ufeffthe top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds you should also know \\ufeffthe following fact from algebra this is simply a mathematical fact that if a is equal to of then a over a is equal to of it doesn't matter what a and a are if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other as shown here you can divide both sides of this equation by a and show that a divided by a is equal to of why is this fact important to us here well it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds then \\ufeffthe ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to of to if a quantity on \\ufeffthe left is equal to a quantity on \\ufeffthe rights a can divide both sides by let's say one hours and what i'll get is of this is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply \\ufeffthe speed of this falcon by of and multiplying by of of course does not change \\ufeffthe quantity so it's a mathematically permissible process more precisely this is what a means of you want to convert something using \\ufeffthe factor-label methods you write \\ufeffthe quantity first and make sure you write \\ufeffthe units down as well miles per hours then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert a want to do two conversions miles and hours so i'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here a know that 1,609 meters is equal to a miles so when a write it as a ratio i'm really just writing of a also know that a hour is equal to 3,600 seconds so when a divide a hour by 3,600 seconds i'm getting of which means basically i'm multiplying \\ufeffthe number 242 by of and then by a again now notice how i've written these ratios out i've chosen to write \\ufeffthe mile in \\ufeffthe denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this miles i've also written \\ufeffthe 3,600 seconds in \\ufeffthe denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have \\ufeffthe hours cancel out to if you look at this products you'll see that miles here cancels miles here and hours here cancels hours here and what we're left with is meters and seconds which is exactly \\ufeffthe same as \\ufeffthe number 242. to a can put everything into my calculator 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second that's \\ufeffthe speed of \\ufeffthe falcon in of units here's another example for you to consider be have a cylinder he cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and \\ufeffthe base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet he base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of a feet calculate \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder in cubic feet notice these quantities these dimensions here are given to you in feet so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of \\ufeffthe problem be do need to know what \\ufeffthe formula for \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder is hopefully you remember that to calculate \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder you must calculate \\ufeffthe base or \\ufeffthe top of \\ufeffthe cylinder which is simply i a squared and then you multiply that by \\ufeffthe height of \\ufeffthe cylinder to now a can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by a and don't forget pic when a put all this into my calculator a find that \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet it should make sense that \\ufeffthe volume is cubic feet because after all i've taken \\ufeffthe radius which was measured in feet and i've squared it so that's feet squared and then i've multiplied it by \\ufeffthe height so that's a third copy of \\ufeffthe same unit so a end up with cubic feet here now let us convert this volume to of units that we want to do is convert feet to meters looking at your books you will find that a meter is approximately a feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet to now what a can do is a can go back and convert \\ufeffthe radius to meters a can also convert \\ufeffthe height to meters and then a can take those converted numbers plug them into this formula use \\ufeffthe formula one more time and calculate \\ufeffthe volume in cubic meters however there is another way of doing it rather than using this formula one more time a can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters of i'm going to do \\ufeffthe foot to meter conversion a need to remember that this is feet cubed so a need three conversion factors to here i've written a meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and i've done it three times and by doing it that way i've made sure that cubic feet here gets cancelled by feet feet and feet here and then what i'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly \\ufeffthe of unit for volume now a can put all this into my calculator a can simply divide it by a divided by a or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and \\ufeffthe final answer is 3.336 cubic meters and that is \\ufeffthe end of this lecture thank you for your attention\",\n          \"to here is something funny you might say OK, what is simpler a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear and \\ufeffthe answer of course a linear theory is much simpler maxwells equations are linear einsteins theory of relativity is very nonlinear very complicated now about classical mechanics is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear that do we think can't hear anyone linear OK. you may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple but it's not this actually is very nonlinear newton could solve \\ufeffthe two-body problem but he couldn't solve \\ufeffthe three-body problem already with three bodies you cannot superposed solutions that you get with two bodies it's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics get me show you of you have motion in one dimensions in 1D, you have \\ufeffthe equation of motion motion in one dimension under a potential a of a that is time independent a particle moving in one dimensions a with under \\ufeffthe influence of a potential a of of he second \\ufeffthe dynamical variable is a of to \\ufeffthe dynamical variable and \\ufeffthe equation of motion is so let me explain this this is force equal mass times acceleration this is mass this is acceleration \\ufeffthe second derivative of \\ufeffthe position and a force is minus \\ufeffthe derivative of \\ufeffthe potential evaluated at \\ufeffthe position derivatives of potentials if you think of a potential \\ufeffthe derivative of \\ufeffthe potential is here positive and you know you have a mass here it tends to go to \\ufeffthe left to \\ufeffthe force is on \\ufeffthe left to it's minus to a prime is \\ufeffthe derivative of a with respect to its argument and \\ufeffthe problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operations if you take two derivatives of a sum of things you take two derivatives of \\ufeffthe first plus two derivatives of \\ufeffthe second but yes this side is linear but this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary and \\ufeffthe derivatives so suppose \\ufeffthe potential is cubic in of a of a goes like a cubed when \\ufeffthe derivative of a goes like a squared and a squared is not a linear function to this newtons equation is not a linear equation and therefore it's complicated to solve very complicated to solve to finally we get to our case quantum mechanics to in quantum mechanics what do we have in quantum mechanics it's linear first you need an equation and whose equation is it Schrodinger's equation 1925. be writes an equation for \\ufeffthe dynamical variable and \\ufeffthe dynamical variable is something called \\ufeffthe wave function this wave function can depend on to depends on time and it may depend on other things as well and it describes \\ufeffthe dynamics of \\ufeffthe quantum system as it evolves in time there is \\ufeffthe wave function and you have an equation for this wave function and what is \\ufeffthe equation for this wave function it's a universal equation i a bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to a hat psi where a hat is called \\ufeffthe hamiltonian and it's a linear operator that's why a had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is this is \\ufeffthe general structure of \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation it's a time derivative and a linear operator to if you wish to write \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation as an a psi equals of then a psi would be defined as i a bar a it of psi minus a hat psi when this is \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation this equation here schrodinger equation and as you can see it's a linear equation you can check it check that a is a linear operator therefore it is naturally linear you can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operations of you have \\ufeffthe a it of a number times a function \\ufeffthe number goes out you differentiate \\ufeffthe function a it of \\ufeffthe sum of two functions you differentiate \\ufeffthe first you differentiate it to this is linear and he we said is linear to a is going to be linear and \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation and therefore you're going to have \\ufeffthe great advantage that any time you find solutions you can scale them you can add them you can put them together combine them in superpositions and find new solutions to in that sense it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics and in fact you will see throughout this semester how \\ufeffthe mathematics and \\ufeffthe things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics are more elegant more beautiful more coherent it's simpler and very nice i is \\ufeffthe square root of minus of is \\ufeffthe imaginary unit and that's what we're going to talk next on \\ufeffthe necessity of complex numbers a bar yes it's a number it shows up in quantum mechanics early on it's called Planck's constant and it began when planck tried to fit \\ufeffthe blackbody spectrum and he found \\ufeffthe need to put a constant in there and then later einstein figured out that it was very relevant to yes it's a number for any physical system that you have you will have a wave function and you will have a hamiltonian and \\ufeffthe hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover to if you have a particle moving on a line \\ufeffthe wave function will depend on time and on of of you have a particle moving in three dimensions it will depend on a vector it may depend on other things as well or it may be like one particle has several wave functions and that happens when you have a particle with spin to in general always time sometimes position there may be cases where it doesn't depend on position you think of an electron at some point in space and it's fixed you lock it there and you want to understand \\ufeffthe physics of that electron locked into place and then position is not relevant to what it does with its spin is relevant and then you may need more than one wave function that is one describing \\ufeffthe spin up and one describing \\ufeffthe spin down to it was funny that schrodinger wrote this equation and when asked so what is \\ufeffthe wave function he said a don't know to physical interpretation for \\ufeffthe wave function was obvious for \\ufeffthe people that invented quantum mechanics it took a few months until tax porn said it has to do with probabilities and that's what we're going to get next to our next point is \\ufeffthe necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

So let's return to the idea of drawing Lewis structures. The first thing I want to say about this is that this is really a process, not an algorithm. If you got the idea from introductory chemistry that drawing Lewis structures based on a formula is, for example, a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at the same Lewis structure, hate to break it to you, but you got the wrong idea. This is more of a process. It's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a Lewis structure. Where the error generally tends to lie is in the first step, which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton. The sigma skeleton shows how the atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds. The sigma skeleton consumes or uses up the sigma electrons in the molecule. The question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good question, and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this. In general, we find less electronegative atoms near the center of Lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds. They have a higher what's called valence, and so we find near the center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence. We can use the way the formula is written as a guide, and you'll start recognizing patterns here. Patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogens bound to a carbon, NO2 indicating two oxygens bound to nitrogen, and even patterns in the way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group. Once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down, we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to the structure until we've satisfied the octet rule and all the valence electrons are used up. So here, for example, we might add a lone pair to this atom, a multiple bond here, maybe a triple bond here, something like this, until we've satisfied the octet rule on every atom and all the valence electrons are used up. And what this means is that the total valence electron count for all of the atoms in the structure is equal to the sum of the sigma electrons, the electrons in the sigma skeleton, and the pi and non-bonding electrons that we find in lone pairs and pi bonds. We then add formal charges based on the formal electron count of each atom relative to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. We'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video. And then finally, we check that the total number of electrons really is equal to the sum of the valence electron counts of all the atoms, and, and this is an important piece that's not on the slide, we also need to consider the overall charge of the molecule in counting up the number of valence electrons. If the charge is negative, we need to add electrons, and if it's positive, we need to take electrons away. So considering the overall charge is very important here as well. This last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in the reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one, if needed, to generate a new sigma skeleton. So really you should think about drawing Lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to the end, you want to evaluate, is the octet rule satisfied, does the structure make sense, and is the structure reasonable? And quite often, you'll need to do this evaluation on Lewis structures that you're looking at or that you've drawn yourself based on given Lewis structures, not for the molecule as a whole, but for specific regions of interest within a molecule, and so this evaluation or this check is really important, particularly for shorthand, which we'll move to in the second half of this video. We alluded to this already, but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in Lewis structures depending on the concept or idea that we're working with. We're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes, the so-called formal electron count, which is used to deal with formal charge, and the so-called total electron count, which is used to assess the octet rule. The formal electron count is defined as the formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing, and by equal sharing, we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms, let's say A and B, and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count the electrons this way. So in this hypothetical molecule, A has one electron, B has one electron, so we don't double count. To determine the total electron count around an atom, we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice, so we take AB and we imagine A has a pair of electrons and B has a pair of electrons. Now, it seems like electrons have come out of thin air, but for the purposes of the octet rule, it's okay to double count electrons like this. So as an example, we can look at the formal electron count in the ammonium ion to calculate formal charge. We think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons, one each from its four bonds to the hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each. So what we do to generate the formal electron count is we split those bonds in half, giving one electron to each of the atoms involved, and then we compare the electron count of each atom to the valence electron count of the neutral atom. If you examine the periodic table, you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons. It's in group 15, and here the nitrogen has four, and so its formal charge here is plus one, because it has one fewer electron in this structure than the neutral atom does. Each of the hydrogens has one valence electron, and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron, and so the charges on the hydrogens are zero, and we typically don't represent this using anything special. We just leave a charge off, and so the molecule as a whole would be drawn with the formal charge near the nitrogen atom, something like this. The total electron count is used to assess the octet rule. In other words, it's used to evaluate whether the octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure. So in applying this analysis to ammonium, we're actually going to give two electrons to the central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at the number of electrons around the nitrogen to determine the so-called total electron count, and we're going to do the same thing with the hydrogens, giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for the purposes of total electron count. So if we focus on the nitrogen, what we find now is that the total electron count is eight, and each of the hydrogens has a total electron count of two, and so while the nitrogen is obeying the octet rule, the hydrogens are actually exceptions to the octet rule, and we'll talk more about the octet rule and its exceptions here in a second. The octet rule says that the total electron count, as we defined it on the last slide, tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures. There are a few important exceptions to the octet rule, and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight. Recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons, one of which I'm going to touch on on this slide. So the first is hydrogen, and we've seen this already. Hydrogen tends to form only one bond. In fact, in all of the structures we'll see in this course, hydrogen forms one and only one bond, and so its total electron count from the perspective of the TEc, as we defined it on the last slide, is only two. This is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row element. It only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell. Neutral group 13 atoms are another famous case of exception to the octet rule, and these have six total electrons according to our convention. So the classic examples are, for example, boron and aluminum. Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight, sometimes, not always. So sulfur, for example, and sulfuric acid is a nice example of this. If we decompose the sulfuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron count, what we find is that the sulfur has two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve electrons around it. Count the total number of bonds here. One, two, three, four, five, six times two is a total electron count of twelve, and that is a crazy violation of the octet rule, but for third-row elements in below, this is okay. The last example I'll mention is carbocation and carbenes, important intermediates in organic chemistry. These are actually analogous to the group 13 elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lesson, but these have six electrons around a carbon atom, either with positive charge, and this is isoelectronic to the group 13 boranes and aluminum compounds, and the carbene is a carbon with four formal electrons, four electrons in terms of valence electron count, but only two bonds. An important thing to note about these species, the atoms with six total electrons, such as the carbocation, carbene, and the group 13 atoms, is that these are often reactive, and they're often reactive in the sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto the atom with only six total electrons on it, so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms. That reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in the semester.\",\n          \" Hi, I'm Professor Akshar at Glendale Community College. This is Physics 101, Lecture 1. In this lecture, we'll discuss units and dimensions. These topics are covered in Chapter 1 of our textbook by Surway and Jouette. Physics is ultimately an experimental science, and as such, we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature. To perform those measurements, we need standards of measurement, or units for our measurements. The three quantities that we will want to measure most often, at least in this class, are length, time, and mass. To measure these three quantities, we will use the International System of Units, which is also known as the SI system. The abbreviation SI refers to the French designation Syst\\u00e8me International. Using the SI system of units, we'll use the meter to measure length, we'll use the second to measure time, and the kilogram to measure mass. The meter and the kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you, hopefully all of you are familiar with the second, but by the end of this semester, you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is. The experimental work that we'll do in the laboratory section of this class should help you with that. In our study of mechanics in this class, we will encounter other units in addition to the meter, the second, and the kilogram. However, any other unit that we encounter, at least in this class, can be represented or expressed in terms of the three base units, the meter, the second, and the kilogram. For example, later in the semester when we study forces, we'll find that the SI unit for force is the newton, and the newton can be expressed in terms of meters, seconds, and kilograms as shown here. So although the newton seems like a new unit, it really is just a combination of the kilogram times the meter divided by second squared. A little bit later, we'll talk about energy in this class, and we'll find that the SI unit for energy is the joule, and the joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared. Shortly after that, we'll talk about power, and we'll learn that the SI unit of power is the watt, and the watt is simply the kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed. At this point, it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from, and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force, energy, and power are. The important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well, because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units. Now, for the sake of completeness, I should mention that there are other base units in physics. It turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units. In this class, we're primarily interested in the meter, which measures length or distance, the second, which measures time or duration. We're interested in the kilogram, which measures mass. But if you go on in physics and engineering, you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature. The SI base unit for measuring temperature is the Kelvin. If you take a course on electricity, magnetism, or circuits, you will want to measure the electric current, and that is measured in amperes. If you've ever taken a course on chemistry, you have probably encountered the mole, which measures the amount of substance. If you want to measure luminous intensity, one would use the candela as the SI base unit. We're really only going to use the first three, but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here. We will need to convert between SI and non-SI units. Primarily, we're interested in SI units. That's our preferred system of measurement. But in different applications, you will inevitably encounter non-SI units, and it's important to know how to go back and forth between the SI and the non-SI units. This table here shows a variety of SI units on the left and non-SI units on the right. Some of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized. You should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimeters. In fact, the prefix centi basically means one one hundredth. So when we talk about a centimeter, we're talking about one hundredth of a meter. Therefore, there are a hundred centimeters to a meter. One meter is equal to 3.281 feet. One meter is also equal to 39.37 inches. A thousand meters is referred to as a kilometer. The prefix kilo means a thousand. So a kilometer or a kilometer is a thousand meters. A mile is approximately 1609 meters. A minute is 60 seconds. An hour is 60 minutes, and each minute is 60 seconds. So 60 times 60 is 3600 seconds to an hour. One kilogram is a thousand grams. A kilogram is also approximately 35 ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds. You don't need to memorize all of these, but some of them, the ones that are in blue, the ones that I've indicated here in this third or last column, are the ones that you should memorize. These are common enough that you will encounter them frequently, and you should know what these conversion factors are off the top of your head. The other conversion factors, the ones that are in black font, are not so important to memorize. It's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are. On an exam, I would probably give you the conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it. Whenever you report the result of a measurement, you should report the units that you used for that measurement, along with the number. That way, the person that is reading your report knows how to interpret the results of your measurement. Units are important in their own right, but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units. Keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations. Keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations. Keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's the right formula for a particular quantity. For example, later in the semester, we will encounter the centripetal force. At this point, it may not be obvious what the centripetal force is. That's not so important. We'll discuss it at length and I'll give you the right formula for it. At some point, you might forget exactly what the formula for centripetal force is. By the end of this semester, you will have encountered hundreds of formulas. On the final exam, you might forget whether the centripetal force is mv divided by r or mv squared over r. In this context, m stands for mass, v stands for velocity or speed, and r is simply distance. Again, we'll talk about all this in much more detail later, but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether the right formula is mv over r or mv squared over r. It turns out if you're paying attention to the units, you can actually figure out which one of these two, the one on the left or the one on the right, is the correct formula. If you have an equation and it's a valid equation, then numerically the left side must equal to the right side, but you want the units to also match. In other words, you want the units of measurement for whatever appears on the left side of the equation to match the units for whatever appears on the right side of the equation. For both of these equations, the left side represents force, as we'll see later, the SI unit for force is the Newton, and a Newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared. I've used the square bracket here. The square bracket indicates the units of. So when I put square brackets around the quantity, I'm not really referring to the value of that quantity. Instead, I'm referring to the unit for that quantity. Now let's look at this formula here on the left. The claim is that force is equal to mv over r. What are the SI units of mv over r? Well, if m is mass, then it's measured in kilograms. V is speed, so it's measured in meters per second, and r is a distance, and that's measured in meters. You can cancel the meter that you see in the denominator here with the one that you see in the numerator, and this reduces to simply kilograms per second. You can already see that this is not a good match. What we have for force is this quantity here, a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared, and what we have for mv over r is this unit. This set of units obviously does not match this set of units, so this is an indication that this formula is wrong. On the other hand, our other formula says force is equal to mv squared over r. The square brackets again indicate the units of mv squared over r. m is kilograms, v is speed. We're going to measure that in meters per second, but it's speed squared, so it's going to be meter squared per second squared, and r is distance, so that's going to be measured in meters. You can see that this m here cancels one copy of the m in the denominator, so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared, and these units match exactly the units for force, or a newton basically. If I'm trying to decide between these two formulas, I can now tell you that the one on the left must be incorrect and the one on the right must be correct. This is not a proof that the formula is correct. However, if you know one of these formulas, then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is the correct one and which one is the incorrect one. As I mentioned earlier, we have to know how to convert between Si and non-Si units. Sometimes these conversions can get complicated, so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions. The method that we want to use in this class is known as the factor-label method. I'll demonstrate the factor-label method using an example problem. The peregrine falcon, considered the fastest animal on earth, has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hour. What is the speed in Si units? So here we've specified the units, but the units are not the same as the units on the left. We've specified the units for speed as miles per hour. Miles and hours are not Si units. If we want to convert to Si units, we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds. So we'll need two conversion factors for this process. Looking through your textbook or perhaps the internet, you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hour. You should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters. And you should know off the top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds. You should also know the following fact from algebra. This is simply a mathematical fact that if A is equal to B, then A over B is equal to 1. It doesn't matter what A and B are, if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other, as shown here, you can divide both sides of this equation by B and show that A divided by B is equal to 1. Why is this fact important to us here? Well, it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, then the ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to 1. So if a quantity on the left is equal to a quantity on the right, I can divide both sides by, let's say, one hour, and what I'll get is 1. This is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply the speed of this falcon by 1. And multiplying by 1, of course, does not change the quantity, so it's a mathematically permissible process. More precisely, this is what I mean. If you want to convert something using the factor-label method, you write the quantity first, and make sure you write the units down as well, miles per hour, then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert. I want to do two conversions, miles and hours, so I'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here. I know that 1,609 meters is equal to 1 miles, so when I write it as a ratio, I'm really just writing 1. I also know that 1 hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, so when I divide 1 hour by 3,600 seconds, I'm getting 1. Which means basically I'm multiplying the number 242 by 1, and then by 1 again. Now notice how I've written these ratios out. I've chosen to write the mile in the denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this mile. I've also written the 3,600 seconds in the denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have the hours cancel out. So if you look at this product, you'll see that miles here cancels miles here, and hours here cancels hours here, and what we're left with is meters and seconds, which is exactly the same as the number 242. So I can put everything into my calculator. 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second. That's the speed of the Falcon in SI units. Here's another example for you to consider. We have a cylinder. The cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and the base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet. The base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of 6 feet. Calculate the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet. Notice these quantities, these dimensions here are given to you in feet, so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of the problem. We do need to know what the formula for the volume of the cylinder is. Hopefully you remember that. To calculate the volume of the cylinder, you must calculate the base or the top of the cylinder, which is simply pi r squared, and then you multiply that by the height of the cylinder. So now I can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by 6 and don't forget pi. When I put all this into my calculator, I find that the volume of the cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet. It should make sense that the volume is cubic feet because after all I've taken the radius, which was measured in feet and I've squared it, so that's feet squared and then I've multiplied it by the height, so that's a third copy of the same unit, so I end up with cubic feet here. Now let us convert this volume to SI units. What we want to do is convert feet to meters. Looking at your book, you will find that 1 meter is approximately 3 feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet. So now what I can do is I can go back and convert the radius to meters. I can also convert the height to meters and then I can take those converted numbers, plug them into this formula, use the formula one more time and calculate the volume in cubic meters. However, there is another way of doing it. Rather than using this formula one more time, I can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters. If I'm going to do the foot to meter conversion, I need to remember that this is feet cubed so I need three conversion factors. So here I've written 1 meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and I've done it three times and by doing it that way I've made sure that cubic feet here gets canceled by feet, feet and feet here and then what I'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly the SI unit for volume. Now I can put all this into my calculator, I can simply divide it by 3 divided by 3 or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and the final answer is 3.336 cubic meters. And that is the end of this lecture. Thank you for your attention.\",\n          \" So here is something funny. You might say, OK, what is simpler, a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear? And the answer, of course, a linear theory is much simpler. Maxwell's equations are linear. Einstein's theory of relativity is very nonlinear, very complicated. How about classical mechanics? Is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear? What do we think? Can't hear anyone. Linear, OK. You may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple, but it's not. This actually is very nonlinear. Newton could solve the two-body problem, but he couldn't solve the three-body problem. Already with three bodies, you cannot superpose solutions that you get with two bodies. It's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics. Let me show you. If you have motion in one dimension, in 1D, you have the equation of motion, motion in one dimension under a potential v of x that is time independent, a particle moving in one dimension, x with under the influence of a potential v of x. The second, the dynamical variable is x of t, the dynamical variable. And the equation of motion is, so let me explain this. This is force equal mass times acceleration. This is mass. This is acceleration, the second derivative of the position. And v force is minus the derivative of the potential evaluated at the position. Derivatives of potentials, if you think of a potential, the derivative of the potential is here positive. And you know you have a mass here. It tends to go to the left. So the force is on the left. So it's minus. So v prime is the derivative of v with respect to its argument. And the problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operation, if you take two derivatives of a sum of things, you take two derivatives of the first plus two derivatives of the second. But yes, this side is linear. But this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary. And the derivative, so suppose the potential is cubic in x. v of x goes like x cubed. Then the derivative of v goes like x squared. And x squared is not a linear function. So this Newton's equation is not a linear equation. And therefore, it's complicated to solve, very complicated to solve. So finally, we get to our case, quantum mechanics. So in quantum mechanics, what do we have? In quantum mechanics, it's linear. First, you need an equation. And whose equation is it? Schrodinger's equation, 1925. He writes an equation for the dynamical variable. And the dynamical variable is something called the wave function. This wave function can depend on t, depends on time. And it may depend on other things as well. And it describes the dynamics of the quantum system as it evolves in time. There is the wave function. And you have an equation for this wave function. And what is the equation for this wave function? It's a universal equation. i h bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to h hat psi, where h hat is called the Hamiltonian. And it's a linear operator. That's why I had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is. This is the general structure of the Schrodinger equation. It's a time derivative and a linear operator. So if you wish to write the Schrodinger equation as an L psi equals 0, then L psi would be defined as i h bar d dt of psi minus h hat psi. Then this is the Schrodinger equation. This equation here, Schrodinger equation. And as you can see, it's a linear equation. You can check it. Check that L is a linear operator. Therefore, it is naturally linear. You can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operation. If you have the d dt of a number times a function, the number goes out. You differentiate the function. d dt of the sum of two functions, you differentiate the first, you differentiate it. So this is linear. And h, we said, is linear. So L is going to be linear. And the Schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation. And therefore, you're going to have the great advantage that any time you find solutions, you can scale them. You can add them. You can put them together, combine them in superpositions, and find new solutions. So in that sense, it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics. And in fact, you will see throughout this semester how the mathematics and the things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics, are more elegant, more beautiful, more coherent. It's simpler and very nice. i is the square root of minus 1, is the imaginary unit. And that's what we're going to talk next on the necessity of complex numbers. h bar, yes, it's a number. It shows up in quantum mechanics early on. It's called Planck's constant. And it began when Planck tried to fit the black-body spectrum. And he found the need to put a constant in there. And then later, Einstein figured out that it was very relevant. So yes, it's a number. For any physical system that you have, you will have a wave function. And you will have a Hamiltonian. And the Hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover. So if you have a particle moving on a line, the wave function will depend on time and on x. If you have a particle moving in three dimensions, it will depend on x vector. It may depend on other things as well. Or it may be like one particle has several wave functions. And that happens when you have a particle with spin. So in general, always time, sometimes position. There may be cases where it doesn't depend on position. You think of an electron at some point in space. And it's fixed. You lock it there. And you want to understand the physics of that electron locked into place. And then position is not relevant. So what it does with its spin is relevant. And then you may need more than one wave function. What is one describing the spin up and one describing the spin down? So it was funny that Schrodinger wrote this equation. And when asked, so what is the wave function, he said, I don't know. No physical interpretation for the wave function was obvious for the people that invented quantum mechanics. It took a few months until Max Born said it has to do with probabilities. And that's what we're going to get next. So our next point is the necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

structures now and talk about \\ufeffthe shorthand that organic chemists use to represent lewis structures containing a large number of atoms and a good deal of structural complexity to let's return to \\ufeffthe idea of drawing lewis structures he first thing a want to say about this is that this is really a process not an algorithm of you got \\ufeffthe idea from introductory chemistry that drawing lewis structures based on a formula is for example a deductive algorithm where we can apply a series of steps and always arrive at \\ufeffthe same lewis structure hate to break it to you but you got \\ufeffthe wrong ideas this is more of a process it's an error-prone sequence of steps that we take to convert a formula into a lewis structure there \\ufeffthe error generally tends to lie is in \\ufeffthe first step which involves drawing what we call a sigma skeleton he sigma skeleton shows how \\ufeffthe atoms are connected to each other through sigma bonds he sigma skeleton consumes or uses up \\ufeffthe sigma electrons in \\ufeffthe molecules he question of what makes a reasonable sigma skeleton is actually a really good questions and there are a few general rules that we can use to think about this in general we find less electronegative atoms near \\ufeffthe center of lewis structures because they tend to form more bonds they have a higher what's called valence and so we find near \\ufeffthe center where they can form a lot of bonds to atoms with smaller valence be can use \\ufeffthe way \\ufeffthe formula is written as a guide and you'll start recognizing patterns here patterns like CH3 indicating three hydrogen bound to a carbon NO2 indicating two oxygen bound to nitrogen and even patterns in \\ufeffthe way parentheses are used like CHOH indicating a carbon bearing a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group once we have what we think is a reasonable sigma skeleton down we move to adding multiple bonds and lone pairs to \\ufeffthe structure until we've satisfied \\ufeffthe octet rule and all \\ufeffthe valence electrons are used up to here for example we might add a lone pair to this atom a multiple bond here maybe a triple bond here something like this until we've satisfied \\ufeffthe octet rule on every atom and all \\ufeffthe valence electrons are used up and what this means is that \\ufeffthe total valence electron count for all of \\ufeffthe atoms in \\ufeffthe structure is equal to \\ufeffthe sum of \\ufeffthe sigma electrons \\ufeffthe electrons in \\ufeffthe sigma skeleton and \\ufeffthe i and nonbinding electrons that we find in lone pairs and i bonds be then add formal charges based on \\ufeffthe formal electron count of each atom relative to \\ufeffthe valence electron count of \\ufeffthe neutral atom we'll talk a little bit more about how to engage this process in a later video and then finally we check that \\ufeffthe total number of electrons really is equal to \\ufeffthe sum of \\ufeffthe valence electron counts of all \\ufeffthe atoms and and this is an important piece that's not on \\ufeffthe slide we also need to consider \\ufeffthe overall charge of \\ufeffthe molecule in counting up \\ufeffthe number of valence electrons of \\ufeffthe charge is negative we need to add electrons and if it's positive we need to take electrons away to considering \\ufeffthe overall charge is very important here as well this last check is really important because it provides us with that evaluation step in \\ufeffthe reasoning process that allows us to potentially revisit step one if needed to generate a new sigma skeleton to really you should think about drawing lewis structures as an iterative process where when you get to \\ufeffthe end you want to evaluate is \\ufeffthe octet rule satisfied does \\ufeffthe structure make sense and is \\ufeffthe structure reasonable and quite often you'll need to do this evaluation on lewis structures that you're looking at or that you're drawn yourself based on given lewis structures not for \\ufeffthe molecule as a whole but for specific regions of interest within a molecules and so this evaluation or this check is really important particularly for shorthand which we'll move to in \\ufeffthe second half of this video be alluded to this already but there are multiple ways we can think about counting electrons in lewis structures depending on \\ufeffthe concept or idea that we're working with we're going to use two different counting schemes for different purposes \\ufeffthe so-called formal electron county which is used to deal with formal charge and \\ufeffthe so-called total electron county which is used to assess \\ufeffthe octet rules he formal electron count is defined as \\ufeffthe formal number of electrons belonging to an atom assuming equal sharing and by equal sharing we mean we're going to take each bond between two atoms let's say a and of and split it in half so that one electron goes to each atom and count \\ufeffthe electrons this way to in this hypothetical molecules a has one electron a has one electron so we don't double county to determine \\ufeffthe total electron count around an atom we actually count each pair of bonding electrons twice so we take of and we imagine a has a pair of electrons and a has a pair of electrons now it seems like electrons have come out of thin air but for \\ufeffthe purposes of \\ufeffthe octet rules it's okay to double count electrons like this to as an example we can look at \\ufeffthe formal electron count in \\ufeffthe ammonium ion to calculate formal charge be think about this central nitrogen atom as having four electrons one each from its four bonds to \\ufeffthe hydrogen atoms and \\ufeffthe hydrogen atoms themselves have one electron each to what we do to generate \\ufeffthe formal electron count is we split those bonds in half giving one electron to each of \\ufeffthe atoms involved and then we compare \\ufeffthe electron count of each atom to \\ufeffthe valence electron count of \\ufeffthe neutral atom of you examine \\ufeffthe periodic table you'll see that nitrogen ordinarily has five valence electrons it's in group 15, and here \\ufeffthe nitrogen has four and so its formal charge here is plus one because it has one fewer electron in this structure than \\ufeffthe neutral atom does each of \\ufeffthe hydrogen has one valence electron and hydrogen as a neutral atom has one valence electron and so \\ufeffthe charges on \\ufeffthe hydrogen are zero and we typically don't represent this using anything special be just leave a charge off and so \\ufeffthe molecule as a whole would be drawn with \\ufeffthe formal charge near \\ufeffthe nitrogen atom something like this he total electron count is used to assess \\ufeffthe octet rules in other words it's used to evaluate whether \\ufeffthe octet rule is satisfied on every atom within a structure to in applying this analysis to ammonium we're actually going to give two electrons to \\ufeffthe central nitrogen atom per bond that it has and look at \\ufeffthe number of electrons around \\ufeffthe nitrogen to determine \\ufeffthe so-called total electron county and we're going to do \\ufeffthe same thing with \\ufeffthe hydrogen giving them two electrons per bond that they're involved in so that each hydrogen is associated with two electrons now for \\ufeffthe purposes of total electron county to if we focus on \\ufeffthe nitrogen what we find now is that \\ufeffthe total electron count is eight and each of \\ufeffthe hydrogen has a total electron count of two and so while \\ufeffthe nitrogen is obeying \\ufeffthe octet rules \\ufeffthe hydrogen are actually exceptions to \\ufeffthe octet rules and we'll talk more about \\ufeffthe octet rule and its exceptions here in a second he octet rule says that \\ufeffthe total electron county as we defined it on \\ufeffthe last slide tends to be eight for atoms in organic structures there are a few important exceptions to \\ufeffthe octet rules and these are situations where atoms have a total electron count very different from eight recognizing these exceptions is very important for a couple of reasons one of which i'm going to touch on on this slide to \\ufeffthe first is hydrogen and we've seen this already hydrogen tends to form only one bond in fact in all of \\ufeffthe structures we'll see in this course hydrogen forms one and only one bond and so its total electron count from \\ufeffthe perspective of \\ufeffthe TEc, as we defined it on \\ufeffthe last slide is only two this is fine for hydrogen because it's a first-row elements it only needs two electrons to complete its valence shell neutral group of atoms are another famous case of exception to \\ufeffthe octet rules and these have six total electrons according to our convention to \\ufeffthe classic examples are for example boron and aluminium Third-row elements in below can have total electron counts that are greater than eight sometimes not always to sulfur, for example and sulphuric acid is a nice example of this of we decompose \\ufeffthe sulphuric acid molecule according to our typical scheme for calculating total electron county what we find is that \\ufeffthe suffer has two four six eight ten twelve electrons around it count \\ufeffthe total number of bonds here new two three four five six times two is a total electron count of twelve and that is a crazy violation of \\ufeffthe octet rules but for third-row elements in below this is okay he last example i'll mention is carbonation and carbines important intermediates in organic chemistry these are actually analogous to \\ufeffthe group of elements in a way that we'll explore in much more detail in a later lessons but these have six electrons around a carbon atom either with positive charge and this is isoelectronic to \\ufeffthe group of borates and aluminium compounds and \\ufeffthe carbine is a carbon with four formal electrons four electrons in terms of valence electron county but only two bonds in important thing to note about these species \\ufeffthe atoms with six total electrons such as \\ufeffthe carbonation carbine and \\ufeffthe group of atoms is that these are often reactive and they're often reactive in \\ufeffthe sense that they want to accept a pair of electrons onto \\ufeffthe atom with only six total electrons on it so all three of these can accept electrons in this manner in reaction mechanisms that reactivity is something to pay attention to as we get into talking about reaction mechanisms later in \\ufeffthe semester\",\n          \"in i'm professor Akshar at glendale community college this is physics 101, lecture of in this lecture we'll discuss units and dimensions these topics are covered in chapter a of our textbook by norway and Jouette. physics is ultimately an experimental science and as such we must make measurements to either verify or falsify our claims about nature to perform those measurements we need standards of measurement or units for our measurements he three quantities that we will want to measure most often at least in this class are length time and mass to measure these three quantities we will use \\ufeffthe international system of units which is also known as \\ufeffthe of system he abbreviation of refers to \\ufeffthe french designation Syst\\u00e8me international using \\ufeffthe of system of units we'll use \\ufeffthe meter to measure length we'll use \\ufeffthe second to measure time and \\ufeffthe kilogram to measure mass he meter and \\ufeffthe kilogram might be unfamiliar to some of you hopefully all of you are familiar with \\ufeffthe second but by \\ufeffthe end of this semester you should have a nice intuitive feel for how big or small each one of these units is he experimental work that we'll do in \\ufeffthe laboratory section of this class should help you with that in our study of mechanics in this class we will encounter other units in addition to \\ufeffthe meter \\ufeffthe second and \\ufeffthe kilograms however any other unit that we encounter at least in this class can be represented or expressed in terms of \\ufeffthe three base units \\ufeffthe meter \\ufeffthe second and \\ufeffthe kilograms for example later in \\ufeffthe semester when we study forces we'll find that \\ufeffthe of unit for force is \\ufeffthe newton and \\ufeffthe newton can be expressed in terms of meters seconds and kilograms as shown here to although \\ufeffthe newton seems like a new unit it really is just a combination of \\ufeffthe kilogram times \\ufeffthe meter divided by second squared a little bit later we'll talk about energy in this class and we'll find that \\ufeffthe of unit for energy is \\ufeffthe joules and \\ufeffthe joule turns out to be a kilogram times meter squared divided by second squared shortly after that we'll talk about power and we'll learn that \\ufeffthe of unit of power is \\ufeffthe watt and \\ufeffthe watt is simply \\ufeffthe kilogram times meter squared divided by seconds cubed it this point it's probably not at all obvious where these combinations come from and it's probably not even obvious exactly what force energy and power are he important point for now is that you really want to know these three units well because every other unit that we introduce in this class at least can be expressed as some product or ratio of these three base units now for \\ufeffthe sake of completeness a should mention that there are other base units in physics it turns out all quantities in physics can be measured in terms of seven base units in this class we're primarily interested in \\ufeffthe meter which measures length or distance \\ufeffthe second which measures time or duration we're interested in \\ufeffthe kilograms which measures mass but if you go on in physics and engineering you'll find that you might be interested in measuring temperature he of base unit for measuring temperature is \\ufeffthe melvin of you take a course on electricity magnetism or circuits you will want to measure \\ufeffthe electric current and that is measured in amperes of you're ever taken a course on chemistry you have probably encountered \\ufeffthe mole which measures \\ufeffthe amount of substance of you want to measure luminous intensity one would use \\ufeffthe candela as \\ufeffthe of base unit we're really only going to use \\ufeffthe first three but it's nice to know that any quantity that you would encounter in this class or any future physics or engineering classes that you may take can always be expressed as some combination of these seven base units shown here be will need to convert between of and non-SI units primarily we're interested in of units that's our preferred system of measurement but in different applications you will inevitably encounter non-SI units and it's important to know how to go back and forth between \\ufeffthe of and \\ufeffthe non-SI units this table here shows a variety of of units on \\ufeffthe left and non-SI units on \\ufeffthe rights home of these conversions you should simply know and have memorized you should know that one meter is equal to 100 centimetres in fact \\ufeffthe prefix cent basically means one one hundredth to when we talk about a centimetres we're talking about one hundredth of a meter therefore there are a hundred centimetres to a meter one meter is equal to 3.281 feet one meter is also equal to 39.37 inches a thousand meters is referred to as a kilometres he prefix kilo means a thousands to a kilometre or a kilometre is a thousand meters a mile is approximately 1609 meters a minute is of seconds in hour is of minutes and each minute is of seconds to of times of is 3600 seconds to an hours one kilogram is a thousand grams a kilogram is also approximately of ounces or approximately 2.2 pounds you don't need to memorize all of these but some of them \\ufeffthe ones that are in blue \\ufeffthe ones that i've indicated here in this third or last column are \\ufeffthe ones that you should memorize these are common enough that you will encounter them frequently and you should know what these conversion factors are off \\ufeffthe top of your head he other conversion factors \\ufeffthe ones that are in black font are not so important to memorize it's probably helpful if you know approximately what they are in an exam a would probably give you \\ufeffthe conversion factor and then expect you to know how to use it whenever you report \\ufeffthe result of a measurement you should report \\ufeffthe units that you used for that measurement along with \\ufeffthe number that way \\ufeffthe person that is reading your report knows how to interpret \\ufeffthe results of your measurement units are important in their own rights but there are other reasons why you should pay attention to units keeping track of units can serve as a check on your calculations keeping track of units can help you avoid careless mistakes in your calculations keeping track of units can sometimes even help you decide what's \\ufeffthe right formula for a particular quantity for example later in \\ufeffthe semester we will encounter \\ufeffthe centripetal force it this point it may not be obvious what \\ufeffthe centripetal force is that's not so important we'll discuss it at length and i'll give you \\ufeffthe right formula for it it some point you might forget exactly what \\ufeffthe formula for centripetal force is by \\ufeffthe end of this semester you will have encountered hundreds of formulas in \\ufeffthe final exam you might forget whether \\ufeffthe centripetal force is my divided by a or my squared over re in this context a stands for mass a stands for velocity or speed and a is simply distance again we'll talk about all this in much more detail later but suppose you're just trying to figure out whether \\ufeffthe right formula is my over a or my squared over re it turns out if you're paying attention to \\ufeffthe units you can actually figure out which one of these two \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe left or \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe rights is \\ufeffthe correct formula of you have an equation and it's a valid equation then numerically \\ufeffthe left side must equal to \\ufeffthe right side but you want \\ufeffthe units to also match in other words you want \\ufeffthe units of measurement for whatever appears on \\ufeffthe left side of \\ufeffthe equation to match \\ufeffthe units for whatever appears on \\ufeffthe right side of \\ufeffthe equation for both of these equations \\ufeffthe left side represents force as we'll see later \\ufeffthe of unit for force is \\ufeffthe newton and a newton is a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared i've used \\ufeffthe square bracket here he square bracket indicates \\ufeffthe units of to when a put square brackets around \\ufeffthe quantity i'm not really referring to \\ufeffthe value of that quantity instead i'm referring to \\ufeffthe unit for that quantity now let's look at this formula here on \\ufeffthe left he claim is that force is equal to my over re that are \\ufeffthe of units of my over re well if a is mass then it's measured in kilograms a is speed so it's measured in meters per second and a is a distance and that's measured in meters you can cancel \\ufeffthe meter that you see in \\ufeffthe denominator here with \\ufeffthe one that you see in \\ufeffthe numerator and this reduces to simply kilograms per second you can already see that this is not a good match that we have for force is this quantity here a kilogram times a meter divided by second squared and what we have for my over a is this unit this set of units obviously does not match this set of units so this is an indication that this formula is wrong in \\ufeffthe other hand our other formula says force is equal to my squared over re he square brackets again indicate \\ufeffthe units of my squared over re a is kilograms a is speed we're going to measure that in meters per second but it's speed squared so it's going to be meter squared per second squared and a is distance so that's going to be measured in meters you can see that this a here cancels one copy of \\ufeffthe a in \\ufeffthe denominator so we're left with kilogram meters per second squared and these units match exactly \\ufeffthe units for force or a newton basically of i'm trying to decide between these two formulas a can now tell you that \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe left must be incorrect and \\ufeffthe one on \\ufeffthe right must be correct this is not a proof that \\ufeffthe formula is correct however if you know one of these formulas then you could use unit analysis to determine which one is \\ufeffthe correct one and which one is \\ufeffthe incorrect one is a mentioned earlier we have to know how to convert between i and non-Si units sometimes these conversions can get complicated so it helps to have a systematic method for doing these conversions he method that we want to use in this class is known as \\ufeffthe factor-label methods i'll demonstrate \\ufeffthe factor-label method using an example problem he peregrine falcon considered \\ufeffthe fastest animal on earth has a top recorded speed of 242 miles per hours that is \\ufeffthe speed in i units to here we've specified \\ufeffthe units but \\ufeffthe units are not \\ufeffthe same as \\ufeffthe units on \\ufeffthe left we've specified \\ufeffthe units for speed as miles per hours files and hours are not i units of we want to convert to i units we'll have to convert miles to meters and we'll have to convert hours to seconds to we'll need two conversion factors for this process looking through your textbook or perhaps \\ufeffthe internet you'll find that one mile is equal to one mile per hours you should also find that one mile is equal to 1,609.34 meters and you should know off \\ufeffthe top of your head that one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds you should also know \\ufeffthe following fact from algebra this is simply a mathematical fact that if a is equal to of then a over a is equal to of it doesn't matter what a and a are if you have two variables or two quantities that are mathematically equal to each other as shown here you can divide both sides of this equation by a and show that a divided by a is equal to of why is this fact important to us here well it's important because it tells us if one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds then \\ufeffthe ratio 3,600 seconds divided by one hour must equal to of to if a quantity on \\ufeffthe left is equal to a quantity on \\ufeffthe rights a can divide both sides by let's say one hours and what i'll get is of this is a key fact for us because we're going to actually multiply \\ufeffthe speed of this falcon by of and multiplying by of of course does not change \\ufeffthe quantity so it's a mathematically permissible process more precisely this is what a means of you want to convert something using \\ufeffthe factor-label methods you write \\ufeffthe quantity first and make sure you write \\ufeffthe units down as well miles per hours then multiply it by a fraction for each unit that you want to convert a want to do two conversions miles and hours so i'm going to multiply by this quantity here and this quantity here a know that 1,609 meters is equal to a miles so when a write it as a ratio i'm really just writing of a also know that a hour is equal to 3,600 seconds so when a divide a hour by 3,600 seconds i'm getting of which means basically i'm multiplying \\ufeffthe number 242 by of and then by a again now notice how i've written these ratios out i've chosen to write \\ufeffthe mile in \\ufeffthe denominator because my goal is to cancel out this mile with this miles i've also written \\ufeffthe 3,600 seconds in \\ufeffthe denominator because my goal is to have seconds left over and have \\ufeffthe hours cancel out to if you look at this products you'll see that miles here cancels miles here and hours here cancels hours here and what we're left with is meters and seconds which is exactly \\ufeffthe same as \\ufeffthe number 242. to a can put everything into my calculator 242 times 1,609 divided by 3,600 gives me 108.183 meters per second that's \\ufeffthe speed of \\ufeffthe falcon in of units here's another example for you to consider be have a cylinder he cylinder has a base radius of 2.5 feet and \\ufeffthe base radius of 2.5 feet is 2.5 feet he base radius of 2.5 feet and it has a height of a feet calculate \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder in cubic feet notice these quantities these dimensions here are given to you in feet so we don't really have to do any conversions for this part of \\ufeffthe problem be do need to know what \\ufeffthe formula for \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder is hopefully you remember that to calculate \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder you must calculate \\ufeffthe base or \\ufeffthe top of \\ufeffthe cylinder which is simply i a squared and then you multiply that by \\ufeffthe height of \\ufeffthe cylinder to now a can take 2.5, square it and multiply that by a and don't forget pic when a put all this into my calculator a find that \\ufeffthe volume of \\ufeffthe cylinder is 117.810 cubic feet it should make sense that \\ufeffthe volume is cubic feet because after all i've taken \\ufeffthe radius which was measured in feet and i've squared it so that's feet squared and then i've multiplied it by \\ufeffthe height so that's a third copy of \\ufeffthe same unit so a end up with cubic feet here now let us convert this volume to of units that we want to do is convert feet to meters looking at your books you will find that a meter is approximately a feet or a little more precisely 3.281 feet to now what a can do is a can go back and convert \\ufeffthe radius to meters a can also convert \\ufeffthe height to meters and then a can take those converted numbers plug them into this formula use \\ufeffthe formula one more time and calculate \\ufeffthe volume in cubic meters however there is another way of doing it rather than using this formula one more time a can simply take this result and directly convert it to meters of i'm going to do \\ufeffthe foot to meter conversion a need to remember that this is feet cubed so a need three conversion factors to here i've written a meter is equal to 3.281 feet as a ratio and i've done it three times and by doing it that way i've made sure that cubic feet here gets cancelled by feet feet and feet here and then what i'm left with is meters times meters times meters and that gives me cubic meters which is exactly \\ufeffthe of unit for volume now a can put all this into my calculator a can simply divide it by a divided by a or simply divide it by 3.281 cubed and \\ufeffthe final answer is 3.336 cubic meters and that is \\ufeffthe end of this lecture thank you for your attention\",\n          \"to here is something funny you might say OK, what is simpler a theory that is linear or a theory that is not linear and \\ufeffthe answer of course a linear theory is much simpler maxwells equations are linear einsteins theory of relativity is very nonlinear very complicated now about classical mechanics is classical mechanics linear or nonlinear that do we think can't hear anyone linear OK. you may think it's linear because it's supposed to be simple but it's not this actually is very nonlinear newton could solve \\ufeffthe two-body problem but he couldn't solve \\ufeffthe three-body problem already with three bodies you cannot superposed solutions that you get with two bodies it's extraordinarily complicated classical mechanics get me show you of you have motion in one dimensions in 1D, you have \\ufeffthe equation of motion motion in one dimension under a potential a of a that is time independent a particle moving in one dimensions a with under \\ufeffthe influence of a potential a of of he second \\ufeffthe dynamical variable is a of to \\ufeffthe dynamical variable and \\ufeffthe equation of motion is so let me explain this this is force equal mass times acceleration this is mass this is acceleration \\ufeffthe second derivative of \\ufeffthe position and a force is minus \\ufeffthe derivative of \\ufeffthe potential evaluated at \\ufeffthe position derivatives of potentials if you think of a potential \\ufeffthe derivative of \\ufeffthe potential is here positive and you know you have a mass here it tends to go to \\ufeffthe left to \\ufeffthe force is on \\ufeffthe left to it's minus to a prime is \\ufeffthe derivative of a with respect to its argument and \\ufeffthe problem is that while this taking derivatives is a linear operations if you take two derivatives of a sum of things you take two derivatives of \\ufeffthe first plus two derivatives of \\ufeffthe second but yes this side is linear but this side may not be linear because a potential can be arbitrary and \\ufeffthe derivatives so suppose \\ufeffthe potential is cubic in of a of a goes like a cubed when \\ufeffthe derivative of a goes like a squared and a squared is not a linear function to this newtons equation is not a linear equation and therefore it's complicated to solve very complicated to solve to finally we get to our case quantum mechanics to in quantum mechanics what do we have in quantum mechanics it's linear first you need an equation and whose equation is it Schrodinger's equation 1925. be writes an equation for \\ufeffthe dynamical variable and \\ufeffthe dynamical variable is something called \\ufeffthe wave function this wave function can depend on to depends on time and it may depend on other things as well and it describes \\ufeffthe dynamics of \\ufeffthe quantum system as it evolves in time there is \\ufeffthe wave function and you have an equation for this wave function and what is \\ufeffthe equation for this wave function it's a universal equation i a bar partial derivative with respect to time of psi is equal to a hat psi where a hat is called \\ufeffthe hamiltonian and it's a linear operator that's why a had to explain a little bit what a linear operator is this is \\ufeffthe general structure of \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation it's a time derivative and a linear operator to if you wish to write \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation as an a psi equals of then a psi would be defined as i a bar a it of psi minus a hat psi when this is \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation this equation here schrodinger equation and as you can see it's a linear equation you can check it check that a is a linear operator therefore it is naturally linear you can see it intuitively because derivatives with respect to time is a linear operations of you have \\ufeffthe a it of a number times a function \\ufeffthe number goes out you differentiate \\ufeffthe function a it of \\ufeffthe sum of two functions you differentiate \\ufeffthe first you differentiate it to this is linear and he we said is linear to a is going to be linear and \\ufeffthe schrodinger equation is going to be a linear equation and therefore you're going to have \\ufeffthe great advantage that any time you find solutions you can scale them you can add them you can put them together combine them in superpositions and find new solutions to in that sense it's remarkable that quantum mechanics is simpler than classical mechanics and in fact you will see throughout this semester how \\ufeffthe mathematics and \\ufeffthe things that we do are simpler in quantum mechanics are more elegant more beautiful more coherent it's simpler and very nice i is \\ufeffthe square root of minus of is \\ufeffthe imaginary unit and that's what we're going to talk next on \\ufeffthe necessity of complex numbers a bar yes it's a number it shows up in quantum mechanics early on it's called Planck's constant and it began when planck tried to fit \\ufeffthe blackbody spectrum and he found \\ufeffthe need to put a constant in there and then later einstein figured out that it was very relevant to yes it's a number for any physical system that you have you will have a wave function and you will have a hamiltonian and \\ufeffthe hamiltonian is for you to invent or for you to discover to if you have a particle moving on a line \\ufeffthe wave function will depend on time and on of of you have a particle moving in three dimensions it will depend on a vector it may depend on other things as well or it may be like one particle has several wave functions and that happens when you have a particle with spin to in general always time sometimes position there may be cases where it doesn't depend on position you think of an electron at some point in space and it's fixed you lock it there and you want to understand \\ufeffthe physics of that electron locked into place and then position is not relevant to what it does with its spin is relevant and then you may need more than one wave function that is one describing \\ufeffthe spin up and one describing \\ufeffthe spin down to it was funny that schrodinger wrote this equation and when asked so what is \\ufeffthe wave function he said a don't know to physical interpretation for \\ufeffthe wave function was obvious for \\ufeffthe people that invented quantum mechanics it took a few months until tax porn said it has to do with probabilities and that's what we're going to get next to our next point is \\ufeffthe necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
